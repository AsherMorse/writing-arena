## Reading Passage: Wilma Rudolph: A Champion of Perseverance

**Paragraph 1**  
Wilma Rudolph was born in 1940 in Tennessee. She was the 20th of 22 children in her family. As a baby, she had many health problems. When she was a young child, she got polio. Before that, she had already learned to walk. But the illness made her left leg weak, and she had to wear a metal brace for many years.

**Paragraph 2**  
Some doctors believed Wilma would never walk again. But her mother never gave up hope. Her family helped her do exercises at home every day. They worked together for years. At the age of 12, Wilma finally took off her brace and walked without help.

**Paragraph 3**  
After learning to walk again, Wilma decided to run. She joined the school's track team and practiced hard. Soon, she was winning races. In college, she kept training and became one of the fastest women in the world.

**Paragraph 4**  
In 1960, Wilma competed in the Olympic Games in Rome. She won three gold medals in track and field. This was the first time an American woman had won that many gold medals at a single Olympics. She became a world-famous athlete and a symbol of strength.

**Paragraph 5**  
After the Olympics, Wilma did not stop working hard. She became a teacher, a coach, and a speaker. She told her story to young people and reminded them to believe in themselves. Wilma said that dreams can come true if you keep trying.
