## Reading Passage: Sally's Rescue

*by Roderick J. Robison*

**1** Anna and Jim sat at the cabin's breakfast table, watching sunlight flicker on the bay after two days of storms. **2** Eager to explore, they ran to the beach where they found a baby seal tangled in fishnet.

**3** "She's beautiful," said Anna. **4** "Maybe she's hurt," added Jim, running to get their parents. **5** Dad gently freed the pup and placed her in the shallow water, but she wouldn't leave.

**6** "I'm going to name her Sally," said Anna.

**7** When two seals were spotted far out in the water, Anna asked, "Do you think they're her parents?"

**8** "Let's give them space," said Dad.

**9** Later, with no sign of the seals, the family placed Sally in a fish box and motored into the bay. **10** When they neared a ledge with two spotted seals, Sally whimpered, leapt from the boat, and joined them. **11** That evening, Anna wondered if they'd really found her family.

**12** "I think we did," said Jim, pointing to three seals bobbing in the water, as if to say thank you, before vanishing into the sunset.
