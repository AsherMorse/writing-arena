## Reading Passage: Don't Give Up on Broccoli!

**Paragraph 1**  
Have you ever tasted a food you instantly disliked? Maybe it was broccoli, dark chocolate, or cottage cheese. Yet after trying it again, you found that you enjoyed it. Many people have this experience because our sense of taste can change. While food preferences begin at a young age, they can be reshaped by curiosity, persistence, and repeated exposure.

**Paragraph 2**  
Researchers at the University of Birmingham discovered what they call a flavor window—a period between four and six months of age when babies are most open to trying new foods. Offering a variety of flavors during this stage helps infants accept unfamiliar tastes later in life. Although the window gradually closes, studies show it can be reopened. Toddlers who try a new food five to ten times often learn to like it, proving that willingness and patience matter.

**Paragraph 3**  
Scientists have identified three ways people learn to like flavors. The first is flavor-nutrient learning, when we associate a taste with how it makes us feel. A child may enjoy cookies because the sugar provides energy. The second is taste-flavor learning, when we connect a new food to one we already like—for example, spreading peanut butter on a new kind of bread.

**Paragraph 4**  
The third type is social learning. People tend to enjoy what friends and family enjoy, even beginning before birth. Babies whose mothers drank carrot juice during pregnancy were more likely to prefer carrot-flavored foods later on. Shared meals and positive talk about food reinforce these preferences.

**Paragraph 5**  
Our tastes continue to evolve throughout life. Children often crave sweets, while adults grow to like vegetables once disliked. Trying a food in different ways—roasted instead of boiled, plain instead of salted—can make it appealing again. With persistence, even broccoli can become a new favorite.
