## Reading Passage: Trees Rise in the Desert

**Paragraph 1**  
The villagers laughed when they saw their neighbor, a farmer named Yacouba Sawadogo, digging many small holes in the dry, hard soil. Each hole, which Yacouba called a *zaï*, was about a foot wide and eight inches deep. They laughed even more when he filled the holes with a mix of animal manure, leaves, and other natural materials that would help the soil. Then, he carefully planted seeds in each hole.

**Paragraph 2**  
"Do you really think those seeds will grow without water?" someone shouted.

**Paragraph 3**  
It was 1980, and Burkina Faso, a country in Africa, had not had good rain in ten years. This part of the world is very dry, between the Sahara Desert and the rain forests. Now, the land was even worse — dry, cracked, and turning into desert. This is called desertification. It happens when land is used too much and there are too many people and animals.

**Paragraph 4**  
Yacouba told people that the rain would come. When it did, most water would slide off the hard ground. But his planting pits would catch and keep the rain. The water would stay in the soil longer, even during dry times. The compost in the holes would help the crops and trees grow. Yacouba believed that in 20 years, his dry land would become green and full of life again. He said people in Africa had used this method a long time ago, and it had worked before.

**Paragraph 5**  
Still, his neighbors didn't believe him.

**Paragraph 6**  
But Yacouba was right. Today, there is a green forest where there used to be desert. Over time, the people who once laughed began copying his method. Now, more farmers in West Africa are using zaï farming and other ways to save water. Yacouba travels and teaches others how to turn dry land into healthy land. He believes there is still hope for the future.
