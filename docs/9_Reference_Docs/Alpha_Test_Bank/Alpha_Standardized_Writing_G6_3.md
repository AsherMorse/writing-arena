## Reading Passage: Monarchs on the Move

**Paragraph 1**  
For his ninth birthday, Carter Steadman didn't want toys or games. Instead, he asked for donations to help monarch butterflies. Carter wanted to build a way station—a small garden where monarchs could rest and lay eggs. With his parents' help, he cleared part of his backyard in Virginia and planted rows of milkweed, the butterflies' favorite food. Then he waited for the monarchs to come.

**Paragraph 2**  
Every fall, millions of monarch butterflies fly thousands of miles from Canada and the United States to the mountains of Mexico. There they spend the winter resting in trees. When spring arrives, new generations begin the long journey north again, stopping to eat and lay eggs along the way. It is one of the most remarkable migrations in nature.

**Paragraph 3**  
In recent years, however, fewer butterflies have completed this journey. People have cleared land for farms and lawns, destroying milkweed plants that monarchs depend on. Strong storms have also damaged the forests where the butterflies spend the winter. Scientists worry that the monarch population is shrinking.

**Paragraph 4**  
To help, thousands of people across North America have become citizen scientists. They tag butterflies with small stickers, count caterpillars, and record monarch sightings online. These reports help scientists understand how the butterflies are doing and where they need protection.

**Paragraph 5**  
Carter continues to raise and tag monarchs in his backyard. He believes that small actions can make a big difference. "Humans may be the problem," he says, "but we're also the solution." Thanks to helpers like Carter, monarchs may have a better chance to survive.
