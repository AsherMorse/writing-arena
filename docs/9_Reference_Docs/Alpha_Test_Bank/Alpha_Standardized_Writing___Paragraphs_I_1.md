## Reading Passage: Digging on Dirt

### Dirt or Soil?

**Paragraph 1**  
Put on your boots, go outside, and dig. What do you find?

**Paragraph 2**  
Did you say dirt? That's true. But you could also say soil. Soil is the word scientists use for dirt.

### Life-Giving Soil

**Paragraph 3**  
Soil covers most of Earth's land. It stretches under grass and in gardens.

**Paragraph 4**  
Soil brings life to Earth. Plants dig their roots deep down to find water and food.

**Paragraph 5**  
Many animals live in soil, too. Wriggling worms and burrowing groundhogs could not live without it.

**Paragraph 6**  
You couldn't live without soil.

**Paragraph 7**  
Plants need soil to grow. Animals eat plants. Without soil, there would be no food!

### Soil's Ingredients

**Paragraph 8**  
So what are the magic ingredients in soil?

**Paragraph 9**  
Soil is made up of rocks, air, and water. Soil is also filled with what's left over of dead plants and animals after they've rotted away.

**Paragraph 10**  
Falling leaves, twigs, and dead bugs land on the ground. As they rot, they change into rich, black humus.

**Paragraph 11**  
Humus might not sound tasty to you, but it's like food for plants!

### Kinds of Soil

**Paragraph 12**  
Sandy soil is coarse and loose. It won't hold much water.

**Paragraph 13**  
Smooth, sticky soil has lots of clay. When this soil dries out, it becomes as hard as concrete. Plant roots can't grow.

**Paragraph 14**  
On the other hand, soil with a lot of silt dries out. The soil might blow away in a cloud of dust.

**Paragraph 15**  
So what kind of soil is just right for growing plants? It has more sand and silt and less clay. It has the same amount of air and water. And it is rich in humus.

**Paragraph 16**  
Go outside and dig again. Is your soil dry and dusty or wet and muddy? Do you see worms and bugs in your soil? What is the soil like where you live?
