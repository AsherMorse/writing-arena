## Reading Passage: Blue-Ribbon Baking

Alisha wrote this story about a special memory. Read Alisha's story and look for revisions she needs to make. Then answer the questions that follow.

### Blue-Ribbon Baking

My grandma bakes an apple pie for the county fair every year. A team of judges tastes all the pies and selects the winners. Grandma Addie has taken second place for three years in a row! This year, I was especially excited because she agreed to teach me her baking secrets.

Every Sunday in September, I rode my bike to her house. We practiced making the pie together, step by step. She is very particular about her recipe, which uses McIntosh and Honeycrisp apples. Grandma Addie showed me how to slice the apples perfectly, mix the filling so the apple flavor would stand out, and make the dough from scratch. She also taught me how to cover the crust with foil to keep it from burning and where to place the pie in the oven. She explained that the right oven spot helps the pie bake evenly.

While each pie baked, we sat at the kitchen table, drinking tea or solving crossword puzzles. Sometimes, we listened to music and talked about other family recipes. I looked forward to those Sundays, and each week I admired my grandma more.

On our final Sunday, we took our time and followed every step carefully. The pie came out looking perfect. But how would it taste? What would the judges think?

Later that afternoon, we walked nervously to the judges' table. We were both thrilled to see right next to our apple pie on the table a first-place ribbon! Grandma Addie still says I was the secret ingredient she needed all along.
