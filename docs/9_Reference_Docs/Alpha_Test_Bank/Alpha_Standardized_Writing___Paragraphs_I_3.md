## Reading Passage: From Collecting to Designing: The Story of Pokémon

**Paragraph 1**  
For over 20 years people all over the world have been collecting the creatures in a game called Pokémon. As a video game designer, the concept for Pokémon was developed by Satoshi Tajiri during his early years. He wanted to create a video game that was different and exciting for people to play.

**Paragraph 2**  
He recalled his love for collecting bugs as a child and used these experiences as inspiration to develop a popular video game. Tajiri's fascination with collecting bugs started when he was young. Tajiri devoted a lot of time to bug collecting because it brought him so much joy. In other words, he was so obsessed with collecting bugs that his friends called him "Dr. Bug."

**Paragraph 3**  
"Every new insect was a wonderful mystery," says Tajiri.

**Paragraph 4**  
As Tajiri got older, he found a new interest in video games. This led him to become a video game designer as an adult. During his schooling at Tokyo National College of Technology, Tajiri concluded that there were not any well-made games. He wanted to change that by creating a game of his own. Tajiri used his personal childhood experience as a bug collector. He decided to make a video game about collecting and sharing different creatures. He called it Pokémon.

**Paragraph 5**  
The idea of Pokémon is to catch each one of the different creatures in the game. The slogan of the game is, "gotta catch 'em all!"

**Paragraph 6**  
There are more than 150 Pokémon species for people to find and collect. When a player sees a creature on the screen, the player uses a ball to help him or her collect the creature. Players may also trade creatures with one another to help them acquire the ones they are missing.

**Paragraph 7**  
To Tajiri, the game's objective of looking for wild Pokémon creatures to capture and share was a lot like his bug collecting as a boy. Tajiri hoped that by playing Pokémon, people would be able to feel the joy he experienced when collecting bugs in his childhood. The success of Pokémon is evident. With over 280 million copies sold, Pokémon is the second most popular game in video game franchise history. For many years, the top-selling video game franchise series has been Super Mario Brothers. Pokémon has also expanded from a video game to a card game, phone app game, television show, and a movie series.

**Paragraph 8**  
Creating Pokémon allowed Tajiri to combine his interests and his skills. The game is the result of Tajiri's skills as a video game designer, as well as his fascination with collecting bugs. Tajiri is a great example of someone who has taken his own passions and turned them into a rewarding experience for others.
