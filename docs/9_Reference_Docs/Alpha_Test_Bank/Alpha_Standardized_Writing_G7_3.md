## Reading Passage: More Than a Whistle

**Paragraph 1**  
Just off the coast of Africa lies the Canary Islands, a small group of islands known for their steep valleys and echoing cliffs. On La Gomera, the second smallest island, visitors often hear more than the songs of birds. Carried across the deep ravines is a whistle that sounds like music yet carries meaning. It is called El Silbo Gomero—the Whistle of Gomera—and it is a spoken language made entirely of tones.

**Paragraph 2**  
No one knows exactly when El Silbo began. Historians believe it may have started with the island's earliest inhabitants and was later adopted by Spanish settlers in the 1500s. For centuries, the whistled language helped people communicate across the island's rugged landscape.

**Paragraph 3**  
Each vowel and consonant in Spanish is replaced by a whistle of different pitch or length. The sounds can travel nearly two miles, far beyond the reach of a shout. Messages once flew from hill to hill: news, invitations, even warnings. Before modern phones and roads, El Silbo was a necessity rather than a curiosity.

**Paragraph 4**  
By the 1980s, however, few people still knew how to whistle the language. The government recognized the risk of losing an important part of the island's identity and made El Silbo classes required in schools. Today, every student learns it, though most adults use it only for cultural events or to entertain tourists. Still, a new generation of islanders—like young whistler Cyro—takes pride in keeping El Silbo alive, carrying the voice of their ancestors through the mountain air.
