## CHAPTER 6

**A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline**

It was more than halfway through the school year, and Ms. Chen was getting anxious. Her tenth graders were still struggling to produce even brief coherent written responses to the prompts she gave them. That was especially true if she asked them to incorporate evidence from the text or analysis into their answers. 

She felt like she'd tried everything. She'd broken the writing process into different components, having them take notes on their reading and use sticky notes or index cards to record the evidence they planned to use. She'd had them create concept maps to help them organize their thoughts. It looked like they had some great ideas. 

But when she got their finished products, she was dismayed to see that students usually provided undigested chunks of information without much in the way of analysis. And it was rare to see a paragraph that had a clear topic sentence—or even anything that actually resembled a paragraph. Sentences followed one another in no particular order, and students often wandered away from their topic. She'd tried other kinds of graphic organizers—Venn diagrams and webs—but nothing seemed to work. 

Ms. Chen sometimes wondered if her efforts to scaffold the writing process had only made things worse. It seemed that many students found the multiple sticky notes and the bubbles in their concept maps more overwhelming than helpful. She had run out of ideas for ways to help them express themselves in a clear, coherent paragraph. How could she send them off to eleventh grade without that essential skill? 

Graphic organizers such as thought webs, Venn diagrams, and bubble maps may be helpful for brainstorming, vocabulary instruction, or helping students grasp certain concepts. However, they don't provide an effective template for transferring those ideas into a coherent piece of writing. A crucial step is missing: taking the material in the bubbles, webs, or boxes and figuring out what is most important, what is least important or irrelevant, and how to put the ideas and points in a logical order. 

Some teachers may have tried the Harvard Outline, with its main ideas, sub-ideas, sub-sub-ideas, Roman numerals, and capital and lowercase letters. Although it has the advantage of a linear structure, and it can serve as a great study guide, we've found that the Harvard Outline doesn't translate well into paragraphs or essays. It goes to the other extreme from the free-form bubble map, requiring such high-level categorization and classification skills that students can get bogged down and confused in the planning process. Even if they do manage to complete such a detailed outline, they may find it difficult to convert the complex structure to written text. 

What Ms. Chen didn't realize was that before asking her students to write, she needed to help them through the process of constructing a simple outline. If she had, she might have found that her students’ paragraphs were far clearer and more coherent. 

Teachers may feel pressure to have students write multiple-paragraph compositions, especially at higher grade levels. But teaching students to outline and write a single coherent paragraph first is a crucial investment of time and energy. In one study done with seventh and eighth graders, students who used TWR's Single-Paragraph Outline achieved better results than those who used a concept map or no planning tool at all—and the



students who got the highest writing scores not only used the outline but also had been explicitly taught how to use it. Students also preferred the outline. Of those who used it, 85 percent said it made writing a paragraph easier. 1

Learning to use certain text structures in the context of a single paragraph—such as problem/solution or cause/effect—will help equip students to plan and write essays using those structures later on. And once students are familiar with TWR outlines, they can easily replicate them on scratch paper when asked to provide written responses on tests, or when planning essays and compositions independently. 

**Remember that students should continue to practice sentence-level strategies while learning to outline and draft paragraphs. **

**You also don't have to wait for students to “master” sentence-level strategies before introducing them to the Single-Paragraph** **Outline. These activities can and should be done in tandem. **

**Defining Terms**

A **paragraph** is a group of sentences that includes details supporting a specific point. A well-written paragraph will display the following characteristics:2

**Structure. ** The sentences in the paragraph are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader. 

**Coherence. ** The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal that connection, including indications of a change of direction or emphasis. 

**Unity. ** Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph. 

**Well-constructed sentences. ** The sentences are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary (some simple, others compound or complex). 

**Guiding Students to Create Effective Outlines**

**WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING THE SINGLE PARAGRAPH OUTLINE (SPO)? **

Provides structure (beginning, middle, and end)

Eliminates repetition

Improves ability to stick to the topic

Enables students to distinguish essential from nonessential material

Provides a guide for placing ideas in logical order

Promotes analytical thinking

Provides a template that students can easily duplicate on their own

Enables students to revise more easily than if they start with a draft

Modulates the cognitive load imposed by writing at length

Reinforces content knowledge

Exhibit 6.1 shows a blank SPO (this template is also available full-size in Appendix G):

**Exhibit 6.1** Blank Single-Paragraph Outline

The simple linear format of the SPO benefits all students. 

Solid lines tell students to write complete sentences for the **topic sentence (T.S.)** and the **concluding sentence (C.S.)**. Dotted lines tell students to write notes for supporting details. 

Exhibit 6.2 is an example of an SPO a student has completed—and after that, the paragraph the student might write based on it. 



T.S. ***Bees, the Earth's best pollinators, are at risk of extinction*****. **



1. ***several species/endangered***

2. ***ex. rusty patch bumble bee. HI yellow-faced bee/EDA***

3. ***human factors*** *→ ↓**bee pop*****. **

4. ***species cont. die*** *→**neg agriculture + ecosyst*****. **

C.S. ***Therefore, saving bee populations is crucial for the environment*****. **



***Bees, the Earth's best pollinators, are at risk of extinction. Several species are listed as endangered. For example, the***

***rusty-patched bumble bee and seven varieties of the Hawaiian yellow-faced bee have been classified as endangered***

***saving bee populations is crucial for sustaining the environment*****. **

**Exhibit 6.2** Example SPO

This chapter provides you with strategies and activities to use when guiding your students to eventually create outlines and paragraphs on their own. 

**SPO Scaffolding Activities**

**The ultimate objective is to enable students to produce an outline independently. However, handing them a blank SPO without** **first teaching them the necessary underlying skills won't produce that outcome. **

Before students can construct an SPO on their own, they will need to learn the steps leading up to that task: creating a topic sentence, including and sequencing relevant details, and crafting a concluding sentence. 

**A topic sentence expresses a paragraph's main idea. ** Make sure students understand that the sentences in the body of a paragraph should provide details that relate to the general idea contained in the topic sentence. 

**When you're modeling using notes for detail sentences, remember not to write full sentences on the dotted lines. ** Usually, when Level 1 students are ready to create SPOs independently, they should also use only key words and phrases for notes, but more experienced writers can add symbols and abbreviations (see Appendix B). 

**RESOURCE**

Symbols and Abbreviations *Appendix B*

When writing in note form on the detail lines, tell students that the notes don't necessarily indicate just one sentence. Specifically, an example or a quotation included on the same dotted line could be written as more than one sentence in the paragraph. 

**A concluding sentence may restate the main idea of the paragraph, although it shouldn't just be a repetition of the topic** **sentence. ** Alternatively, depending on the type of paragraph, a concluding sentence might express a point of view or a call to action. 

**WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING TOPIC AND CONCLUDING SENTENCES? **

Enables students to make generalizations

Promotes analytical thinking

Enables students to identify key information or concepts

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Developing topic and concluding sentences requires students to consider a collection of facts and information and decide what characteristics unite them—in other words, to develop the ability to make generalizations. Many of the activities that follow will help students in identifying and creating both topic and concluding sentences. Once students have created an effective topic sentence, constructing the concluding sentence is often an easier job. 

**Sequence of SPO Scaffolding Activites:**

1. Create an SPO with the whole class. 

2. Distinguish a T.S. from details. 

3. Identify T.S. and sequence details. 

4. Given T.S., select relevant details from a list. 

5. Eliminate irrelevant detail(s) from a list or SPO. 

6. Given T.S., generate details. 

7. Practice the three strategies for writing a T.S. and C.S. 

8. Given topic/prompt, generate T.S. 

9. Given details, generate T.S. 

10. Given T.S. and details, generate C.S. 

11. Given topic/prompt, construct SPO independently. 

**1. Create an SPO with the Whole Class**

You should have your students practice the steps involved in creating an SPO before asking them to develop one themselves, but it's helpful to demonstrate the entire process first so they know where they're headed. When modeling the SPO for Level 1 students, consider selecting topics that are not complicated or don't require searching for new information. 

Level 2 students can begin learning how to construct SPOs based on a current curriculum topic if most students in the class have already acquired enough information about it to help generate topic and concluding sentences and details. 

There are two ways to develop an SPO with the whole class. One, as shown in the following example, is to have students come up with a topic sentence and then narrate a series of details related to it, perhaps in chronological order. 

**Level 1 Narrative Example**

T.S. ***Try growing bean plants at home*****. **



first 1. ***holes in bottom of container***

next 2. ***put soil in and dig holes***

then 3. ***put seeds in and cover***

finally 4. ***water every day***

C.S. ***It is exciting to watch seeds grow into plants! ***



***Try growing bean plants at home. First, you should put holes in the bottom of a container. Next, put soil in it and dig***

***holes. Then, you put seeds in the holes and cover them with soil. Finally, be sure to water your plants every day. It is***

***exciting to watch your seeds grow into plants! ***

**Level 2 Narrative Example**

T.S. ***It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid. ***



first 1. ***clean container***

next 2. ***fill w/ few in. of liquid***

then 3. ***dip test strip/few sec. ***

finally 4. ***compare color/litmus scale***

C.S. ***If you follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is acidic, neutral, or alkaline. ***

***It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid. First, thoroughly clean the container you are using. Next, fill the container***

***with a few inches of the liquid you are testing. Then, dip the test strip in the liquid for a few seconds. Finally, compare***

***the color you see to the litmus scale. If you follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is acidic, neutral, or***

***alkaline. ***

The second way to develop an SPO involves brainstorming. The steps that you would take are:

1. Identify a topic, audience, and purpose. 

2. Help students brainstorm 10–15 details about a topic and organize them into categories. 

3. Generate a topic sentence on the solid line on the top of the outline using one of the three TWR strategies (sentence types, subordinating

conjunctions, appositives).* **This can be done before the brainstorming if preferred. **

4. Select, categorize, and sequence details and write them in note form on the dotted lines. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion of TWR note-taking techniques.) *Note that every brainstormed item does not have to be included on the SPO*. 

5. Generate a concluding sentence using one of the three TWR strategies (sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives) on the solid line

at the bottom of the outline.**

*Level 2 students can use all three: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and appositives. Level 1 students should begin with sentence types and then three of the subordinating conjunctions: *before, after, if*. 

**A concluding transition may be appropriate to use at the beginning of the concluding sentence. 

**Level 1 Brainstorming Example**

**TOPIC:** Winter

***soup***

***cold + icy***

***sweaters***

***New Year's Eve coats and scarves ice-skate, ski, sled***

***hot chocolate***

***holiday foods***

***lip balm***

***cozy blankets***

***boots***

***make a snowman***

***hats + gloves***

***cloudy***

***snowy***

T.S. ***Winter is a unique time of year. ***



1. ***cold, snowy, cloudy days***

2. ***coats, sweaters, hats, gloves***

3. ***hot chocolate, soup, holiday foods***

4. ***skiing, sledding, making a snowman***

C.S. ***Clearly, winter is an exciting season! ***



**Level 2 Brainstorming Example**

**TOPIC:** Achievements of Aztecs

***herbal treatments*** *→**cure diseases***

***1st. civ/dev edu syst*** *→**all children attended***

***adv. calendar*** *→**improved farming***

***adv. math syst*** *→**used area for construction***

***built pyramids/temples for ceremonies***

***built chinampas = floating gardens*** *→**crops*** *↑*

T.S. ***The Aztecs, a Mesoamerican civilization, had many outstanding achievements. ***

1. ***adv. math system*** *→**used area for construction***

2. ***1st civ./dev edu system*** *→**all children attended***

3. ***built pyramids/temples for ceremonies***

4. ***built chinampas = floating gardens*** *→**crops*** *↑*

C.S. ***The contributions of the Aztecs had a great impact on subsequent civilizations. ***

Now that students have an idea of what the end product looks like, it's time to introduce them to the steps involved in creating an SPO. Each step has value in itself and will help students think more analytically, find important points more efficiently, and take notes more effectively. In addition, each step requires modeling by the teacher, as well as oral and collaborative practice, before students can engage in it independently. 

Once students have learned these steps, they not only will be ready to construct an SPO independently but also will have most of the skills they'll need when they move on to planning compositions. 

**2. Distinguish a T.S. from Details**

To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence, present them with three or more sentences and ask them to identify the topic sentence and the sentence or sentences that provide supporting details. You could start with three sentences and ask students to mark one with *T.S*. for *topic* *sentence* and the other two with *D* for *detail*. 

This example assumes that the students have read  *Miss Nelson Is Missing! * 3

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and the supporting details using *D*. 

*** D*** Students had to do lots of homework. 

***T.S*****. ** Ms. Swamp was a very strict teacher. 

*** D*** She cancelled story hour. 

The next example is embedded in content relating to medieval Europe. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and the supporting details using *D*. 

***D*** Art and literature began to reflect the times by including themes of death. 

***D*** Many landowners were ruined financially due to a lack of laborers to cultivate the land. 

***T.S*****. ** The Bubonic Plague, a dreadful disease, had a significant impact in Europe. 

***D*** One third of Europe's population, 25 million people, died. 

***D*** Since many laborers died, many families lost their means of survival. 

**3. Identify T.S. and Sequence Details**

You can increase the level of difficulty by giving students groups of three to five sentences and asking them to first identify the topic sentence and then put the remaining sentences in a logical sequence. This activity will help them understand how to sequence ideas or events within a paragraph. 

In this activity, the transition words signal the sequence of the detail sentences. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and number the supporting details in the correct order. 

***2*** Then, the seed sprouts a plant with flowers. 

***T.S*****. ** The growth of a pumpkin is interesting. 

***3*** Finally, the flowers disappear, and the pumpkin grows! 

***1*** First, a seed is planted in the ground. 

Students who have been studying the Mughal Empire might complete the following activity. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and number the supporting details in the correct order. 

***1*** Babur started the empire and removed the Delhi Sultanate. 

***3*** Jahangir continued the policy of tolerance toward Hindus along with most of Akbar's policies. 

***2*** After Babur, Akbar, the greatest Mughal Emperor, laid the foundation for many future leaders. 

***T.S*****. ** There were many rulers of the Mughal Empire. 

***4*** Shah Jahan also continued Akbar's policies and built the Taj Mahal. 

**4. Given T.S., Select Relevant Details from a List**

Provide students with two different topic sentences and a list of details. Have students write each detail under the topic sentence it belongs with. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

long lines

play games

buy souvenirs

lots of walking overcrowded water rides

T.S. Amusement parks are exciting. 

1. ***play games***

2. ***buy souvenirs***

3. ***water rides***

T.S. Amusement parks are exhausting. 

1. ***long lines***

2. ***lots of walking***

3. ***overcrowded***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

occurs in 4 steps

1 diploid cell → 4 haploid cells

daughter cells clone = gen. identical

males make 4 sperm/females only 1 egg

crossing over during proph. 1 → genetically unique cells

seq. of 2 divisions

1 diploid cell → 2 diploid cells

T.S. Mitosis, a step in the cell cycle, results in the division of the nucleus. 

1. ***occurs in 4 steps***

2. ***daughter cells clone = gen. identical***

3. ***1 diploid cell*** *→**2 diploid cells***

4. ***used to reprod. somatic cells***

T.S. Meiosis, a type of cell reproduction, is the process organisms use to make gametes, sperm, and eggs. 

1. ***crossing over during proph. 1*** *→**genetically unique cells***

2. ***seq. of 2 divisions***

3. ***1 diploid cell*** *→**4 haploid cells***

4. ***males make 4 sperm/females only 1 egg***

**5. Eliminate Irrelevant Detail(s) from a List or SPO**

Some students have difficulty distinguishing relevant from irrelevant details or go off topic when they write. If some of your students fall into that category, have them underline or put *T.S*. next to the topic sentence in a list and then cross out the detail that has the least connection to the topic sentence. 

This example assumes that the students have read *The Snowy Day*. 4

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail. 

________ He made a snowman. 

*** T.S*****. ** Peter had a wonderful time on a snowy day. 

________ Peter had a dream that the snow melted. 

________ He made snow angels. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail. 

________ Then, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation. 

________ There is only one variable in the equation. 

________ Divide both sides by 3 to solve for *x*. 

*** T.S*****. ** Follow 3 steps to solve 3(x+5) = 45. 

________ Distribute the 3 inside the parentheses to get 3x + 15 = 45. 

**6. Given T.S., Generate Details**

In this activity, you provide students with a topic sentence that you've created on a blank SPO template and have them generate three or four details to go with it. 

For a Level 1 group, you might start with the following sentence. 



**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence. 

T.S. Dogs are popular pets. 

1. ***protective***

2. ***loyal***

3. ***playful***

If you've been teaching Level 2 students about the Incan Empire, you could give them the following sentence. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence. 

T.S. Although the Incan Empire was in power for less than one hundred years, parts of its culture lives on today. 

1. ***Quechuan language***

2. ***celebrate winter solstice***

3. ***textile making***

4. ***irrigation + architecture***

**7. Practice the Three Strategies for Writing a T.S. and C.S. **

When students were doing sentence-level work, they learned strategies to help them create topic sentences. When first explaining how to use these strategies for topic sentences, you should provide the topic and make sure it's one that students are familiar with. 

If you are guiding Level 2 students through the formulation of topic sentences, tell them about all three strategies (see Exhibit 6.3). If you're teaching

Level 1 students, just discuss the first two—sentence types and subordinating conjunctions—and limit the latter to the conjunctions *before*, *after*, and *if*. 

**Exhibit 6.3** Three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences

**Use a sentence type. **

Students may use a statement, a question, an exclamation, or (possibly) a command. For example, the topic sentence for a paragraph about Washington, DC might be, *Have you ever been to Washington, DC? * Note that while exclamations and commands can be helpful for younger students who are learning to write paragraphs, middle and high school students should generally not use them for topic sentences. 

**Begin with a subordinating conjunction. **

A Level 1 student might use a subordinating conjunction such as *before* to form a topic sentence. For example: *Before you get a dog, you need to* *make preparations*. A Level 2 student might use a more sophisticated conjunction such as *although*—as in *Although the New Deal did not solve* *all of the nation's problems, it saved the United States from economic collapse*. 

**Include an appositive. **

A paragraph about New York City could start with *New York, the nation's largest city, is visited by many tourists*. A paragraph about Genghis Khan might begin *Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, created a large empire*. 

Have your students practice using these strategies to transform boring topic sentences into engaging, informative ones. 

These three strategies are also useful in formulating concluding sentences—which we'll address further on in this chapter. 

**8. Given a Topic/Prompt, Generate T.S. **

After students have had practice writing topic sentences using the three strategies, give them a topic and ask them to create two or three topic sentences for it. Level 1 students are expected to write topic sentences using only sentence types and the subordinating conjunctions *before*, *after*, and *if*. 

If students have been studying endangered species, you might give them the following activity. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write two topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence type and one starting with a subordinating conjunction. 

**TOPIC:** Endangered sea turtles

Sentence Type

***Why are sea turtles endangered? ***

Subordinating Conjunction

***Since sea turtles are endangered, steps must be taken to protect them. ***

**Level 2 Example**

If your Level 2 students have been studying the environment, you might give them the topic *climate change* and ask them to write three topic sentences using each of the three strategies: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and appositives. They might come up with the following sentences. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write three topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence type, one starting with a subordinating conjunction, and one including an appositive. 

**TOPIC:** Climate change

Sentence Type

***What is the leading cause of climate change? ***

Subordinating Conjunction

***Since climate change has rapidly worsened weather extremes, steps must be taken to reverse it. ***

Appositive

***Climate change, a deviation from usual weather or temperature, has become an urgent problem. ***

**9. Given Details, Generate T.S. **

Provide students with an SPO without topic sentence. The details should be presented in note form. Notes for Level 2 students should include key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols, while notes for Level 1 students should use just key words and phrases. This activity will require students to synthesize a number of details to come up with a topic sentence that brings them all together. 

**Level 1 Example**

If Level 1 students have been learning about the life cycle of a butterfly, you could give them an SPO such as the following one and have them provide a topic sentence. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details. 

T.S. ***Penguins are endangered. ***



1. Emperors + Adélies dropped by 1/2 since 1980s

2. Antarctic sea ice not forming in winter

3. krill disappearing/need sea ice

Students might use the details shown in the following example—and the knowledge that enables them to identify the era being discussed—to generate a topic sentence. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details. 

T.S. ***The Mayans were a complex Mesoamerican civilization. ***



1. present-day Mexico/Yucatan Peninsula

2. polytheistic/sun + moon + rain gods

3. accurate calendar + math + pyramids

4. possible drought + famine/disease

**10. Given T.S. and Details, Generate C.S. **

The same basic techniques that have enabled students to craft effective topic sentences will work for concluding sentences—with one twist. A concluding sentence should echo the idea of the topic sentence but not repeat it verbatim. 

In some types of writing, the concluding sentence should introduce something new—perhaps a call to action or a personal opinion. However, in many cases, a paraphrase or summary of the topic sentence can serve as the concluding one. Consider the following examples. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and details. 

T.S. What makes summer a special season? 



1. *warm weather*

2. *shorts and T-shirts*

3. *watermelon and ice cream cones*

4. *baseball, fishing, swimming*

C.S. ***In conclusion, summer is an enjoyable time of year! ***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and details. 

T.S. ***The Renaissance was a time of tremendous advancements in many areas. ***



art 1. *Michaelangelo/DaVinci*

education 2. *Gutenberg/printing press*

inventions 3. *watches/microscope*

science 4. *Copernicus/Galileo → astronomy*

C.S. ***The 14th–17th centuries marked a time of major cultural change in Europe. ***

As we discussed in Chapter 4, one way to make a sentence sound more like a concluding one is to introduce it with an appropriate transition, such as

*finally* or *in conclusion*. 

It's best if the topic and concluding sentences don't repeat the same structure. For example, if the topic sentence includes an appositive, then encourage students to use a different structure for the concluding sentence—perhaps a subordinating conjunction or an exclamation. 

**11. Given Topic/Prompt, Construct SPO Independently**

If students have been reading *Mae Among the Stars*,5 you might give them the following activity. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic. 

**TOPIC:** Mae Jemison

T.S. ***Mae Jemison dreamed of going to space. ***



1. ***read books about space***

2. ***teacher suggested being nurse***

3. ***followed dream***

4. ***became astronaut***

C.S. ***Mae Jemison made her dream come true! ***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic. 

**TOPIC:** Spanish-American War

T.S. ***The Spanish-American War of 1898 marked a turning point in American and Spanish history. ***

1. ***Cuba wanted independence from Spain/US support***

2. ***sinking USS Maine/Havana Harbor*** *→* ***tensions*** *↑*

3. ***Apr 1898 US declared war on Spain***

4. ***US victory/Dec 1898 Treaty of Paris*** *→* ***ended war***

C.S. ***The Spanish-American War led to the end of Spanish colonial rule and signaled the emergence of the United States***

***as a global power. ***

**SPO: Text Structures**

An SPO enables students to use almost any text structure, including the following standard ones:

Narrative

Descriptive

Problem/solution

Cause/effect

Pro/con

Compare-and-contrast

Opinion/persuasive

You can choose one of the following outlines for a whole-class introduction to adapting the SPO for different text structures, using the sequence of steps described in the preceding sections. If your students have sufficient knowledge about something they've already studied or are studying, you can embed the activity in that content. 

**Narrative**

T.S. ***In 1912, the sinking of the Titanic, a luxury ship, was a disaster. ***



1. ***built for safety/“unsinkable” ***

2. ***speed/ignored signals*** *→**hit iceberg***

3. ***only 20 lifeboats/confusion***

4. ***1500 died/most 1st & 2nd class survived***

C.S. ***Many lessons were learned from this catastrophe. ***



**Descriptive**

T.S. ***Sailing first class on the Titanic was an incredible experience for its millionaire passengers. ***

1. ***cabins = 5 rooms***

2. ***several restaurants + lounges***

3. ***high speed telegraphs/elevator***

4. ***gym, pool, Turkish baths***

C.S. ***The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger ship of its time. ***



**Problem/Solution**

T.S. ***Even though Galileo invented the telescope, Newton and Herschel implemented many modifications that make it***

***what it is today. ***

Problem 1. ***shape of lens/blurry images***

Solution 2. ***made longer*** *→**increased magnification 50–100x***

C.S. ***The Louisiana Purchase, a critical event in U.S. history, strengthened and expanded the nation. ***



**Pro/Con**

T.S. ***Although he was difficult to work with, Isaac Newton made important contributions to science. ***

– 1. ***accusations of plagiarism***

– 2. ***paranoid about sharing work/sabotaged others***

+ 3. ***1687/published “Math Principles” *** *→**redemption***

**Turning an Outline into a Draft**

After your students have put together a coherent SPO, they are ready to convert the outline into a draft. They'll need to expand their notes on the dotted lines into complete sentences and add those sentences to the topic and concluding sentences they've already written. 

When students convert their SPOs into a draft, the resulting paragraph will be logically organized, on topic, and non-repetitive. At the same time, though, it may not be engaging to a reader. To make their writing flow, students will need to apply the revision techniques that we'll introduce in the next chapter. Those techniques will draw on skills they've acquired through sentence-level activities. 

Bear in mind that leading your students through the process of developing an SPO and later having them complete one independently is a valuable exercise in itself, regardless of whether it results in a written paragraph. Creating an outline deepens and cements students' knowledge of the content it relates to and develops their ability to make generalizations and put information into a logical sequence. **Be sure to give your students plenty** **of opportunities to develop outlines without turning them into drafts and final copies. **

**Differentiating SPO Activities**

For students who need more support in completing an SPO, you can provide the topic or the concluding sentences—or both—and have them write in notes for the details. Students who need less support can come up with their topic and concluding sentences independently. 

Have some students use only key words and phrases for their notes on the dotted lines, while having others use abbreviations and symbols as well. 

If some students need more help coming up with details, you could provide them with cues in the margin while letting others come up with detail categories on their own. 

**To Sum Up**

The SPO is linear and simple, enabling students to order details that support the main idea and eliminate irrelevant information. 

Model the process of creating an entire SPO as a whole-class activity for both Levels 1 and 2 before introducing activities that focus on the SPO scaffolds. 

To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence and learn to organize and sequence details, use the SPO scaffolding activities. 

Build on students' knowledge of sentences to introduce the strategies for constructing topic and concluding sentences: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and (for Level 2 students) appositives. 

Guide students through the process of creating non-repetitive concluding sentences. 

As with sentence activities, it's important to keep circling back to the SPO scaffold activities to reinforce the skills used to develop SPOs and to serve as comprehension checks.
