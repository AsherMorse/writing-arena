## CHAPTER 8

**Summarizing: Finding the Main Idea of a Text**

Ms. Buxbaum's eleventh-grade social studies class had been studying the American Revolution and its aftermath. She'd given her students an article to read on the Constitutional Convention and asked them to summarize it. 

Jamal's summary went on for three pages, recounting details such as the names of the first few colonies to select delegates in the early months of 1787, the oppressive heat in Philadelphia that summer, and the introduction and rejection of the New Jersey Plan. 

Felicia's summary, on the other hand, was just two simple sentences:

*Delegates from the colonies met in Philadelphia. They drafted the Constitution*. 

Neither of these summaries was exactly what Ms. Buxbaum had in mind. Jamal clearly knew a lot about the Constitutional Convention, but had trouble distinguishing important events from colorful but essentially irrelevant details. And Felicia's summary had left out some crucial information—like when the Constitutional Convention had taken place. 

Ms. Buxbaum realized that students like Jamal and Felicia needed more guidance in exactly what a summary should include. But she wasn't sure how to provide it. 

Students often have trouble figuring out how much to say and what to focus on when they're asked to summarize. How much is too much? How much is too little? What's important and what's not? Teachers’ guides may require students as young as second grade to summarize a chapter or an entire book. Yet even many high school students find it challenging to come up with a good summary, struggling to find the right level of succinctness or detail. 

**The Power of Writing Summaries**

A **summary** is a brief statement that presents the main points of a text, in a concise form, either in writing or orally. 

Teachers sometimes underestimate the importance and the challenges of having their students learn to craft effective summaries. Summarizing is so powerful because it requires you to get to the essence of whatever you're trying to summarize. If you transfer a mental or oral summary to written form, it can be especially powerful because you have to think even more intensively about what you want to say. A written summary is also easier to critique and rework. But writing also imposes a greater cognitive load than thinking or speaking, and inexperienced writers can find it challenging to create a written summary without explicit instruction. 

Students at any grade or ability level can learn to summarize, although your approach may vary depending on your students’ skill level, the complexity and knowledge demands of the text, and other factors. The skills students have acquired through learning to expand a sentence or create a Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO) will give them a valuable boost in writing summaries. 

**WHY PRACTICE SUMMARIZING? **

Boosts reading comprehension

Acts as a comprehension check

Helps generate concise and accurate responses to questions

Maintains focus on the main idea and most relevant details

Teaches paraphrasing techniques

Provides practice synthesizing information

Enhances the ability to analyze information

Develops the ability to make generalizations

Aids in retaining information and vocabulary

Summarizing information is something we all need to do, often many times a day—and not only inside a classroom. Just to name a few examples, summarizing comes into play when we're asked to do any of the following:

Relate an experience or process

Describe someone or something

Sum up a plot

Give directions

Present a critical review

The difficulty of summarizing varies with the content, the complexity of the language and syntax, and the depth of knowledge the reader has about the topic. To see what we mean, try summarizing the following paragraph, which appears on the first page of Immanuel Kant's *Critique of* *Judgement*:1

*We proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide Philosophy, as containing the principles of the rational cognition of things by means of* *concepts (not merely, as logic does, principles of the form of thought in general without distinction of Objects), into theoretical and practical. *

*But then the concepts, which furnish their Object to the principles of this rational cognition, must be specifically distinct; otherwise, they would* *not justify a division, which always presupposes a contrast between the principles of the rational cognition belonging to the different parts of a* *science*. 

Not so simple, especially if you don't have a graduate-level degree in philosophy! 

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Reviews of multiple studies have found that summarizing can be a powerful boost to reading comprehension and learning. 2 When students

are taught how to create summaries, the research has found that the practice helps them identify the main idea of a text, make generalizations, and retain information. 

One review of the research found that the effects were particularly strong in the elementary grades. It also found that writing summaries worked better than simply having students read a text multiple times, read and study it, or receive instruction in reading skills. 3

Teachers are often told they should have students summarize material, but they're not necessarily told why or how. Now that we've explained why summarizing is important, we'll tell you how to teach this critical skill. 

**Three Questions to Ask before You Begin**

Before you ask your students to start summarizing, there are three questions you'll need to answer first. 

**Do your students have sufficient knowledge of the topic to summarize it? ** It's best to embed summarizing activities into the content you're teaching and to ensure that you have spent enough time on that content to enable students to write about it intelligently. 

**What is the purpose of the summary? ** Is it a comprehension check you'll collect or a study aid for your students? 

**What is the format? ** Will the summary be a single sentence, an outline, or a paragraph? 

**Two Structures for Summaries**

The following two formats, the summary sentence and the SPO, will help your students structure their thoughts about the information they have read, heard, or collected. Which one you use will depend on the text to be summarized, the purpose of the summary, and the ability level of your students. Both formats will require your students to go back into the text, read closely, and find the main idea and most important points. 

As always, it's a good idea to complete these activities as a class before asking students to try them on their own. 

**The Summary Sentence**

The first format, the **summary sentence** template, looks a lot like the one your students have used for sentence expansion. The question words are the same, and summarizing draws on many of the same skills as sentence expansion, but there is no kernel sentence provided as a starting point. 

Instead, students will be summarizing a specific text—a story, a paragraph, a book chapter, or an article. 



**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the summary sentence. It is not necessary to use all the question words. Respond only to the ones that are relevant. 

Who/What? 

***Maya ***

(did/will do) What? ***built urban centers***

When? 

***pre-Columbian era***

Where? 

***throughout their empire***

Why? 

***N/A***

How? 

***expertly***

**SUMMARY SENTENCE:** ***During the pre-Columbian era, the Maya expertly built urban centers throughout their empire*****. **

When you give your students a text to summarize, clarify what you want them to focus on when they create their summaries if the content lends itself to several possibilities. When students are expanding a brief kernel sentence, the focus is clear. But a paragraph, article, or chapter may cover a range of possible subjects. If you want students to focus on one aspect of the text, be sure to make that subject explicit. 

For example, let's say you've asked students to summarize an article about tornadoes occurring in a particular state, and you expect them to focus on the

damage the tornadoes caused. Some students might choose to focus instead on the timeline of the events or the areas and people that were impacted. 

Unless you designate the subject, you may not get back the kind of summary you anticipate. 

In addition, make sure students know that they won't need to answer all the question words that are listed. When students are still learning to create summary sentences, it's important to guide them through thinking about which question words will be relevant for a specific text and tell them that if a certain word isn't appropriate, they should put “N/A” (not applicable) on the dotted line next to it. 

Many newspapers and magazines summarize their articles in a single sentence at the beginning as a way of letting readers know what will follow. 

Often, book and movie reviews and television shows are summarized in a single sentence. Consider showing your students how frequently this type of brief summary appears. 

**The end product of the summary sentence activity is an informative, coherent sentence that could often work as the topic** **sentence of a paragraph. Standing alone, it serves as a way of identifying the main idea of a text. **

**TEACHER TIPS**

Have students create a summary sentence at the beginning of a class as a do-now activity, based on homework or material that was previously covered. 

Review material that the class has covered. For example, if students have been reading *Macbeth*, try having them summarize one of his soliloquies. 

Students should write their answers to the question words in the form of notes on the dotted lines. 

Begin summary sentences with the answer to the *when* question, if that's appropriate for the text being summarized. 

Single-sentence summaries can be practiced orally, as a whole-class activity, to help students stay concise and on topic. 

Be sure to post the question words prominently. 

**BE CAREFUL**

Simpler texts, particularly those that have been “modified” or “adapted,” are harder to summarize because they include less information and therefore are effectively already summarized. Make sure the text you're giving students to summarize has enough detail and complex language to enable them to distill it. 

At the same time, the text shouldn't be so complex that students can't understand it. Text selection can be tricky, so teachers should be the ones to do it rather than the students, at least initially. 

**Summarizing with the SPO**

Students can use the SPO to plan a paragraph that provides a summary. Many of the same skills they learned in connection with the SPO are also involved in developing summaries:

Distinguishing between essential and nonessential information

Reducing text to notes or paraphrases

Organizing the points they want to make

Synthesizing information and making generalizations

Rephrasing a topic sentence as a concluding one

When students use the SPO for a summarizing activity, they will be referring to a specific source and mining it for the information they'll need to complete the outline. Students will need to do the following:

Identify details that support the topic. 

Generate a topic sentence. 

Select and sequence supporting details. 

Write the details as notes on the dotted lines. 

Generate a complete concluding sentence. 

When introducing summarizing, a sixth-grade teacher asked his students to read an article about the importance of wearing the right sunglasses. 4

Next, the whole class developed the following SPO. The paragraph following the SPO was written independently. 

T.S. ***While cost and style are factors to consider when shopping for sunglasses, effective protection is most important*****. **

1. ***UVA + UVB = damaging rays*** *→**cataracts***

2. ***decal/absorb 99-100% harmful rays/polarized***

3. ***style/wrap-around***

4. ***cloudy days + winter*** *→**UV radiation***

C.S. ***In conclusion, wearing well-chosen sunglasses throughout the year is crucial for protecting the health of your eyes*****. **

***While cost and style are factors to consider when shopping for sunglasses, effective protection is most important. ***

***Consumers need to know about the dangers of UVA and UVB rays because they can cause great damage, including***

***cataracts. Look for a decal stating that the glasses are polarized and can absorb 99–100% of harmful rays*****. *Wrap-***

***around styles are best for protecting your eyes on all sides. Many people don't know that UV radiation exists on cloudy***

***days and during the winter. As a result, their eyes can be at risk. To conclude, be diligent when shopping for the safest***

***sunglasses*****. **

**To Sum Up**

Summarizing builds on skills students have developed in sentence expansion activities and in creating SPOs. 

Before asking students to summarize, make sure they have sufficient knowledge of the topic to understand the text you're asking them to summarize, and that they can identify the intended purpose and format of the summary. 

Make sure students have had ample practice with sentence expansion before tackling summary sentences, which are significantly more challenging. 

When asking students to complete the templates for the summary sentence, first make sure they understand what to fill in for the

“who/what” and “did/will do (what)” lines in order to clearly identify the topic. 

Students who have been introduced to the SPO can use it to summarize specific text. 

Have students practice summarizing both orally and in writing.
