## CHAPTER 4

### **Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity**



At the beginning of the school year, Mr. White gave his third graders a prompt to get a sense of their writing ability: “Please write a paragraph about the best part of your summer.” 

The response from Lola in Exhibit 4.1 was pretty typical. 

**Exhibit 4.1**

Mr. White tried to focus on the positive. Lola had written complete sentences, and she'd spelled most of the words correctly. Her capitalization and punctuation were also exemplary, and she had even used an apostrophe. In addition, the entire paragraph was focused on the topic of the prompt. 

On the other hand, the sentences in Lola's paragraph all had the same simple structure. One ended in an exclamation point instead of a period, but that was about it for variety. Basically, her paragraph was just a list. 

In previous years, Mr. White had tried to help his students create more complex sentences, but his suggestions—for example, not to end almost every sentence with an exclamation point—hadn't had much effect. 

He had also tried encouraging students to create sentences that were more like those in the children's literature they read, but they didn't seem to know how to do that. In fact, it wasn't always clear they understood those complex sentences. 

The fact is, some students may not know how to vary their sentence structure unless they've been explicitly introduced to different types of sentences and how to use them. Once they're aware of the possibilities, they're in a much better position to create engaging prose that incorporates a range of structures, including complex sentences with multiple clauses. 

And, as we've mentioned, teaching students how to construct complex sentences can also boost their reading comprehension.1 Because the syntax, or

sentence structure, of written language is more complex than that of spoken language, it's often unfamiliar and confusing for students. Written sentences may have multiple clauses, and the subject and verb may be separated by a lot of other information. That can lead students to assume, for example, that the word closest to the verb is the subject of the sentence even when it's not. 

Even children's books often use more complex syntax than adult conversation. 2 As the grade levels go up and students are expected to read texts with

increasingly complex syntax—including original historical documents—lack of familiarity with complex syntax can pose a serious barrier to comprehension. 

The following excerpts from children's literature, a classic work of fiction, and a historical document illustrate the complexity and length of sentences that students may encounter and find difficult to understand. 

***Next morning when the first light came into the sky and the sparrows stirred in the trees, when the cows rattled their***

***chains and then roosters crowed and the automobiles went whispering along the road, Wilbur awoke and looked for***

***Charlotte. *** 3

***Charlotte's Web***** by E.B. White**



***In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by some sage women in the***

***neighborhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming***

***personally acquainted, first that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and***

***spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born toward the small***

***hours on a Friday night. ***4

***David Copperfield***** by Charles Dickens**



**When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have** **connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws** **of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the** **causes which impel them to the separation. **5

**The United States Declaration of Independence**



Lack of familiarity with complex syntax is a widespread problem. According to one study of around 25,000 American students, only 10 percent of eighth graders are able to “evaluate complex syntax.” 6 It's also a problem that isn't limited to historically disadvantaged groups or struggling readers. 

One Harvard English professor found that when she taught *The Scarlet Letter*, her students “were really struggling to understand the sentences as sentences—specifically, they were having trouble identifying the subject and the verb.” 7

Students need to learn to walk before they can run, though. Before moving on to concepts like **subordinating conjunctions**, **transitions**, and **appositives**, let's start with the fundamentals. 

**The Four Basic Sentence Types**

All sentences, no matter how complex, can be boiled down to these four types:

**Declarative sentence (statement)**

Sets forth an idea or argument; the most common type of sentence. 

*Example:* ***Theodore Roosevelt created five national parks***. 

**Imperative sentence (command)**

Gives advice or instructions or expresses a request or an order. 

*Example:* ***Visit a national park*****. **

**Interrogative sentence (question)**

Makes an inquiry and always ends with a question mark. 

*Example:* ***How can the national parks be protected? ***

**Exclamatory sentence (exclamation)**

Expresses force or a strong emotion and ends with an exclamation point. 

*Example:* ***National parks must be protected! ***

**WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-TYPE ACTIVITIES? **

Enables students to vary sentence structure

Provides one of the three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences

Introduces students to developing questions

Helps students learn correct punctuation

Reinforces spelling, vocabulary, and academic knowledge

Introducing students to the four sentence types will pay off when it comes time for them to write paragraphs and essays and you ask them to vary their sentence structure. 

**Distinguishing between the Sentence Types**

After explaining the four different sentence types, have your Level 1 students practice distinguishing between them. Explain that *S* stands for *statement*; *Q*, for *question*; *E*, for *exclamation*; and *C*, for *command*. You might give them the following activity: **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the sentence type (S, Q, E, C). 

***S*** Tony doesn't want to go. 

***Q*** Does Tony want to go? 

***E*** Don't go, Tony! 

***C*** Go now. 

You can use sentence-type activities to teach punctuation. For example, you can give students different types of unpunctuated sentences and ask them to add the appropriate punctuation. Tell them that commands can end with a period or an exclamation point. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Add the correct punctuation to each sentence:

Anna doesn't want to go **. ** 

Does Anna want to go ***? *** 

Don't go, Anna ***! *** 

**Using Sentence-Type Activities to Assess and Reinforce Knowledge and Vocabulary**

If you are teaching the word *fluctuate*, you can ask students to write each sentence type using the word in any of its forms. They might give the following answers:

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence of each type using the word *fluctuate* in any form. 

Statement: ***Climate change is causing extreme fluctuations in the weather. ***

Question: ***What causes body temperature to fluctuate? ***

Exclamation: ***Fluctuating weather patterns can be dangerous! ***

Command: ***Prepare for extreme fluctuations in weather*****. **

Not all topics lend themselves to all four sentence types. To determine which sentence types are appropriate for a particular activity, remember to always anticipate student responses. 

In a math class, students could write the following sentences with the word *diagram*. 



**DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence of each type using the word *diagram*. 

Statement: ***The diagram represents 1/2. ***

Question: ***Is a diagram a visual representation? ***

Command: ***Draw a diagram that has four sides and measures 360 degrees. ***

As an alternative to putting one word into the four sentence types, consider using several words that are relevant to what your students are studying. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each sentence type using the following words. 

register (command)

***Register to vote***. 

elections (statement)

***There are national, state, and local elections. ***

vote (exclamation)

***Every vote counts! ***

democracy (question)

***How are citizens represented in a democracy? ***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write two statements and two questions using the following words. 

prophase (statement)

***Prophase is one of the phases of mitosis. ***

eukaryotic cells (statement)

***Mitosis can only occur in eukaryotic cells. ***

mitosis (question)

***What are the five phases of mitosis? ***

chromosome (question)

***How many chromosomes does each cell produced by mitosis have? ***

**Differentiating Sentence-Type Activities**

If some of your students need extra support or an additional challenge, here is a possible modification:

Ask more advanced students to create all four sentence types, while asking others to create only statements and questions. 

**How to Develop Knowledge and Skills? A Good Question**

**WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING QUESTIONS? **

Encourages students to think about the important features in text

Encourages close reading

Helps students to focus on the key elements of questions

Gives students practice in understanding and using expository terms (see Appendix A) Helps students anticipate what questions they may be asked

Reinforces knowledge and vocabulary

Develops analytical abilities

**RESOURCE**

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

It's as important for students to learn how to generate questions as it is for them to learn how to answer them. When students formulate questions, they're developing higher-level cognitive functions while at the same time focusing on the main idea of the content that provides the basis of their



question. 

For example, imagine that you needed to formulate a question about the paragraph you just read. You might need to read it several times, asking yourself what it's really all about. Perhaps you'd come up with the following:

*Why is it important for students to learn how to generate questions? *

or:

*What skills or abilities do students develop when they formulate questions? *

If you embed question activities in the content your students are learning, you'll encourage them to retrieve information from long-term memory, read and reread text closely to ensure their recollection is correct, and think deeply about what they're learning. 

**Developing Questions about Images**

An excellent way of introducing your students to the skill of developing questions is to show them a picture and ask them to come up with two or three questions based on what they see. If the picture is related to the content of the curriculum—for example, a political cartoon or a depiction of a historical event in a history class—and you ask students to write both questions and responses, you'll also be able to check your students' 

understanding of the material. 

**Level 1 Example**

You could give your Level 1 students the following picture to practice developing questions when they are being introduced to the book *Ox-Cart* *Man*. 8

**DIRECTIONS:** Write three questions about the picture. 

1. ***When does this story take place? ***

2. ***Why is there a cow pulling the cart instead of a horse? ***

3. ***What's going to go in the cart? ***

**Level 2 Example**

You could give Level 2 math students the following activity:





**DIRECTIONS:** Write three questions and answers about the picture. 

1Q: ***Are the shapes congruent? ***

1A: ***The shapes are congruent*****. **

2Q: ***Which quadrant are both figures in? ***

2A: ***Both figures are in quadrant 1*****. **

3Q: ***What type of transformation is this? ***

3A: ***This transformation is a rotation*****. **

**Using Expository Terms**

Appendix A (“Expository Writing Terms”) lists terms that call for a specific type of response—for example,  *analyze* or *compare*. The following activity will help students understand the different meanings of these terms when they encounter them on tests or in text. If they've used the terms *enumerate* and *summarize* in formulating their own prompts, they're less likely to become confused when they see directions using those terms. You can ask your students to formulate test or assignment instructions using the expository terms and then respond to them. 

**RESOURCE**

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

Depending on grade level and the content the class is studying, students might come up with the following. Asking students to provide the answers is optional. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write three directions using the words *compare*, *summarize*, and *describe* about *frogs* and *toads*. 

1: ***Compare frogs and toads*****. **

2: ***Summarize the differences between frogs and toads*****. **

3: ***Describe the appearances of frogs and toads*****. **

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write three directions and answers about *absolute rulers* using the words *describe*, *enumerate*, and *explain*. 

1: ***Describe the role of absolute rulers in medieval Europe*****. **

1A: ***Absolute rulers had total control over their countries*****. **

2: ***Enumerate possible reasons for opposition to absolute rulers*****. **

2A: ***First, people had no political power. Second, the rulers controlled the practice of religion. Lastly, they had total***

***control over the economy*****. **

3: ***Explain why absolute rulers believed they were entitled to their power*****. **

3A: ***Absolute rulers believed that they had a divine right to rule*****. **

**Conjunctions, Complexity, and Clauses**

**Conjunctions** include words such as *because* and *but*. Using conjunctions to connect words, phrases, and clauses provides more information for the reader and helps make writing clear and linguistically rich. 

A **clause** is a group of words in a sentence that contains a subject and a verb. There are two types of clauses: An **independent (main) clause** represents a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. For example, in the sentence *The teacher* *was happy because I did my homework*, *The teacher was happy* is an independent clause. 

A **dependent (subordinate) clause** does not express a complete thought and could not stand alone as a complete sentence. In the previous example, *because I did my homework* is a dependent clause. 

Conjunction activities enable students to craft more complex sentences. As students do so, they also develop the ability to understand such sentences when they encounter them in their reading. 

**Simple but Powerful: *because*****, *but*****, *so***

A powerful TWR sentence activity is known as *because-but-so*. It's a great illustration of how an exercise that seems simple can actually require students to think analytically. 

**WHY PRACTICE BASIC CONJUNCTIONS? **

Develops the ability to write extended and elaborated responses

Checks student comprehension

Develops analytical thinking

Fosters close reading

Provides practice in using new vocabulary words correctly

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

This is how you should proceed: give students **sentence stems**—the beginning of a sentence—and have the students turn them into three separate sentences, using each conjunction. This approach requires them to engage in far more specific and focused thinking than just asking them to respond to an open-ended question. Think about the difference between asking students, “Why do seeds need light to grow?” and framing the assignment as follows:

Seeds need light to grow because

Seeds need light to grow, but

Seeds need light to grow, so

Make sure your students understand the meanings of each conjunction. You could explain it to them this way:

*because* explains why something is true, why something happened, or why a certain condition exists

*but* indicates a change of direction

*so* tells us what happens as a result of something else—in other words, a cause and its effect

As with other TWR activities, the content of *because-but-so* drives its rigor. When you adapt the activity to the content you're teaching, be sure to anticipate student responses and ensure that your students have enough content knowledge to complete the activity successfully. 

In addition to guiding your students to create compound and complex sentences, this activity will prod them to think critically and deeply about the content they're studying and encourage them to refer back to the text. It will also provide you with a precise check of your students' comprehension. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians because ***it provided fertile soil for farming*****. **

The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians, but ***annual floodwaters caused destruction***

The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians, so ***the river was worshiped as a god*****. **

You can also use this activity to give students practice with new vocabulary or spelling words. Embed those words in the stems you create. For example, if your students have just learned the word *mediocre*, you can give them the following sentence stems: **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre because ***the menu was limited*****. **

The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre, but ***others believed it was excellent*****. **

The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre, so ***he rated it 3 stars instead of 5 in his review*****. **

Depending on the content you're teaching and the ability of your students, you could also give students different stems about the same topic to complete rather than the same one with all three conjunctions. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Diversity in a gene pool is better for survival because ***more favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive and produce***

***offspring*****. **

Evolution occurs slowly over long periods of time, but ***that is not the case with bacteria resistant to antibiotics*****. **

Populations tend to grow and exceed their limited resources, so ***competition results in differential survival*****. **

With Level 1 students, practice this activity orally before having students try it in writing. To introduce the idea, start with a simple stem embedded in familiar content or common knowledge—for example, “The teacher was happy ____________.” Students might respond orally with answers such as these:

The teacher was happy because ***we raised our hands*****. **

The teacher was happy, but ***she still gave us homework*****. **

The teacher was happy, so ***she gave us a longer recess*****. **

Once your students grasp the concept, embed the activity in content you're currently covering. If your class is studying Abraham Lincoln, you could give students the stem, “Abraham Lincoln was a great president because ___________.” The activity would look like this: **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Abraham Lincoln was a great president because ***he kept the country united*****. **

Abraham Lincoln was a great president, but ***critics have called him a dictator because of his broad use of emergency powers*****. **

Abraham Lincoln was a great president, so ***more books have been written about him than any other American president*****. **

You might just focus on one conjunction at a time with Level 1 students by giving students two or three different stems to complete with *because*. If students have been reading *Malala's Magic Pencil*, 9 you might give them the following activity:

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Malala wished for a magic pencil because ***she wanted to use it to bring peace to the world*****. **

Dangerous men tried to silence Malala because ***her voice became so powerful*****. **

Malala wrote about her life because ***she wanted more people to know what was happening to girls in her city*****. **

**Differentiating Basic Conjunction Activities**

You can easily modify the *because-but-so* activity to accommodate students at different ability levels. Give all students the same stem, but ask more proficient students to provide complete sentences for all three conjunctions while asking others to write a sentence for only one or two. 





**BE CAREFUL**

Keep the following points in mind when creating and assigning *because-but-so* activities:

**Formatting matters! ** The underlined blank space for completing the stem should appear on the same line as the conjunction itself, **not** on a separate line below it. Otherwise, students may capitalize the word after the conjunction and write another sentence instead of a clause. 

**INCORRECT FORMATTING:**

The war was won because

***The colonists were determined to protect their country. ***

**INCORRECT FORMATTING:**

The conjunctions should **not** be given as a list without repeating the stem:

The war was won because

but

so

Students may try to put all three conjunctions in one sentence:

***The war was won because the colonists were determined to protect their country but there were many casualties so***

***the United States was able to gain its independence*****. **

It's important to follow the correct format for *because-but-so* activities as shown in the examples—supplying the stem for each sentence and following each conjunction with a solid blank line that students should use to complete the sentence. 

**CORRECT FORMATTING:**

The war was won because ***the colonists were determined to protect their country*****. **

The war was won, but ***there were many casualties*****. **

The war was won, so ***the United States was able to gain its independence*****. **

Anticipate your students' responses when developing activities with these conjunctions. Always complete the stems yourself before asking your students to do so. 

Students should not create stems because they may omit information that is important to include. 

Be sure students know the word *so* isn't being used in the sense of “I admire Nelson Mandela *so much*.” Instead, it introduces a phrase that tells us what happened as a result of something else. 

Be mindful of the difference between *so* (shows cause and effect) and *so that* (often gives a reason instead of a result). For example: Hammurabi created a written code of laws ***so that*** he could establish justice in Babylon. 

Hammurabi created a written code of laws, ***so*** Babylon experienced a period of stability. 

Not every text will lend itself to activities using all three conjunctions. For example, if a text provides only positive information about Abraham Lincoln's presidency, students will have difficulty completing the *but* sentence shown in the example. In that case, you should only give students the conjunctions *because* and *so*. 

If students use *because*, *but*, and *so* to begin sentences, they're likely to write a fragment rather than a complete sentence. As they become more competent writers, they can begin to use these conjunctions to start sentences. 

Make sure students follow *but* with contrasting information on the same topic rather than providing information on a different topic. 

Tell students they need to place a comma before *but* when it connects two independent clauses. A comma is not needed before *but* when it connects an independent clause and a fragment (dependent clause). 

As always, make sure that students have had the opportunity to acquire the information they will need to complete the activity. 

**Adding Complexity: Subordinating Conjunctions**

**WHY PRACTICE SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS? **

Promotes the use of complex sentences

Improves reading comprehension by familiarizing students with syntax they'll encounter in their reading

Enables students to vary sentence structure

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Encourages close reading and references to text

Checks student comprehension

Enables students to extend their responses

Provides a strategy for creating topic and concluding sentences

A subordinating conjunction is a word like *before* or *unless* that introduces a dependent (subordinate) clause and signals the relationship between that clause and the main idea. For example, in the sentence *Although I drank a glass of water, I was still thirsty*, the subordinating conjunction *although* introduces a clause relating to *I was still thirsty*. Subordinating conjunctions are often used in written language but not as frequently in spoken language. In conversation, we would be more likely to say *I drank a glass of water, but I was still thirsty*. 

The following subordinating conjunctions are used frequently to begin sentences in writing. They are listed in Exhibit 4.2 in the order in which they

are taught to Level 1 students (they can be taught to Level 2 students in any order):

1. After

2. Before

3. If

4. When

5. Even though

6. Although

7. Whenever

8. Since

9. While

10. Unless

**Exhibit 4.2**

Subordinating conjunctions can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. However, it's best to begin instruction using them at the beginning of a sentence, which is why they're capitalized in the preceding chart. Once your students learn to use subordinating conjunctions, they'll be able to place them elsewhere. They'll also be able to write extended responses that are rich in complexity and content. 

**When students begin writing paragraphs and essays, they can use subordinating conjunctions to create topic or concluding** **sentences that are interesting and informative. **

**Introducing Students to Subordinating Conjunctions**

To develop your students' skill in using subordinating conjunctions, give them introductory dependent clauses that you've created and ask them to complete the sentences. As with sentence stems using *because-but-so, * this approach demands more analytical thinking and precision than merely asking open-ended questions. 

For example, there is a significant difference between asking a student *“* Why was the Industrial Revolution important?” and asking them to complete the following stems:

Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits,____________

Before England embarked on the Industrial Revolution, ______________

When a stem begins with *although*, students need to find contrasting or contradictory information. If they use *before*, they need to demonstrate their understanding of the chronology of events. 

**Level 1 Examples**

Students in primary grades can practice completing stems, either orally or in writing, based on books you've introduced in read-alouds. With Level 1

students, it's best to start with conjunctions that depend on chronology ( *before*, *after*) or the conjunction *if*. 

If you've been reading them the book *Chicks and Salsa*,10 for example, you could give them the following stems, and students might provide these

answers:

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem. 

Before the chickens made salsa, ***they crept into the garden to get tomatoes and onions*****. **

After the ducks were inspired by the chickens, ***they took cilantro from the garden to make guacamole*****. **

If you've read your students the book *From Seed to Plant*,11 the stems and answers might look like these:



**DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem. 

Before a flower can make seeds, ***it has to be pollinated*****. **

If a seed isn't on or in soil, ***it will not sprout*****. **

After a seed germinates, ***the root grows down into the soil*****. **

**Level 2 Examples**

If you're teaching English and your students have been reading *Metamorphosis*, 12 you might give them the following stems to complete, and they

might provide the answers shown:

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence. 

Although Grete is benevolent toward Gregor, ***she is repulsed by him*****. **

Since she wants Gregor to eat, ***Grete begins a monotonous feeding routine*****. **

If Grete had not shown compassion toward Gregor, ***he probably would have died sooner. ***

When students are learning about *buoyancy* in a science class, the stems and answers might look as follows: **DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem. 

If an object has a higher average density than a liquid, ***the object is not buoyant enough to float*****. **

When an object has a larger surface area touching a liquid, ***the liquid exerts more upward force on the object*****. **

**Connecting Ideas: Transitions**

**WHY PRACTICE TRANSITION ACTIVITIES? **

Helps students identify and show the relationship between ideas

Provides logical connections between sentences, paragraphs, and sections within compositions

Enables students to signal how a reader should react to or process the information presented

Makes writing more readable and engaging

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Transitions are often called *signal words* because they signal, or indicate, a relationship between ideas. They can make text smoother and help minimize the confusion that brief or unelaborated statements can cause. 

Explain to students that, as a general rule, when transitions appear at the beginning of a sentence, they are followed by a comma. The term *transition*

can refer to words that appear in the middle of a sentence, but we'll be using the term to refer to words at the beginning of a sentence. (See Exhibit

4.3.)

**Types of Transitions**

**Time and sequence**—provide sequence of events, steps in a process

**Conclusion**—express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution

**Illustration**—give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement

**Change of direction**—signal contrasting thoughts

**Emphasis**—prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated

**Exhibit 4.3** Transition Words and Phrases

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*



**TECHNICAL TIP**

It's a good idea to display the following posters of frequently used transitions as easy references and reminders for students to use them. 

These posters list the transition words and phrases that students are most likely to encounter in texts and literature. A more extensive table of transition words and phrases can be found in Appendix C. 

**Introducing Transitions**

The best way to introduce students to transitions is through the sentence-level activities we describe in this chapter. Students will eventually use transitions to connect sentences and paragraphs. 

When introducing students to transitions, begin with time-and-sequence, conclusion, and illustration transitions. 

**Time-and-Sequence Transitions**

These are transition words and phrases such as *first*, *second*, and *finally*. Students will find them helpful when writing narratives that relate a chronological series of events or steps in a process. They are especially helpful when explaining a solution to a math problem, describing a process in science, writing a summary of a plot, or tracing the timeline of an event. 

You may want Level 1 students to stay with simple time-and-sequence transitions such as *first*, *second*, and *finally, * along with *then* and *next*

(category 1A in Appendix C). More advanced students can use words such as *initially* and *previously* (category 1B in Appendix C). 

One way to have students practice using transitions is to give them a sentence followed by a transition word or phrase that introduces the next sentence. Students can complete the second sentence in a way that fits the transition word you've provided. Alternatively, you can provide the second sentence but leave a blank space for them to supply an appropriate transition. 

**Level 1 Example**

The class trip to the Museum of Natural History was interesting. First, ***we visited the insect exhibit*****. **

or

The class trip to the Museum of Natural History was interesting. ***First, *** we visited the insect exhibit. 

**Level 2 Example**

There are a number of factors to consider when choosing sunglasses. Initially, ***you need to be careful that the lenses absorb 99–100% of***

***UVA and UVB rays*****. **

or

There are a number of factors to consider when choosing sunglasses. ***Initially, *** you need to be careful that the lenses absorb 99–100% of UVA and UVB rays. 

**Conclusion Transitions**

Students should use conclusion transitions to introduce the last sentence in a paragraph or the first sentence of the concluding paragraph in a composition. 

Conclusions can simply summarize the ideas in a piece of writing, in which case a transition like *in summary* would be appropriate. Other conclusions focus on a solution or the author's point of view. More advanced students can practice deciding when it would be better to conclude with a summation or a statement that goes beyond that. 

Some conclusion transitions, like *as a result* and *therefore*, should be used to introduce the endings of cause-and-effect paragraphs and compositions. These cause-and-effect transitions are marked in Appendix C with an asterisk. 

**Level 1 Example**

Often plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in the ocean. As a result, ***many sea animals may become extinct*****. **

or

Often plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in the ocean. ***As a result, *** many sea animals may become extinct. 

**Level 2 Example**

This example assumes students have read *Hatchet*. 13

The smoke from the fire keeps the mosquitoes and birds away from Brian's shelter. Therefore, ***he is able to maintain his food supply*****. **

or

The smoke from the fire keeps the mosquitoes and birds away from Brian's shelter. ***Therefore, *** he is able to maintain his food supply. 

**Illustration Transitions**

Illustration transitions are used to give examples, to support a detail, or to explain or elaborate on a statement with evidence. For example, one illustration transition is—in fact— *for example*. Illustration transitions can be introduced to students who are at the higher end of Level 1. Younger students can be introduced to the phrase *for example* if it's done orally as a whole-class activity, under a teacher's guidance. 

**Level 1 Example**

Each of the gods had his or her area of responsibility. For example, ***Apollo was the god of music and the sun*****. **

or

Each of the gods had his or her area of responsibility. ***For example, *** Apollo was the god of music and the sun. 

**Level 2 Example**

The Agricultural Revolution changed people's lives. Specifically, ***humans began to farm and plant on their own fields*****. **

or

The Agricultural Revolution changed people's lives. ***Specifically, *** humans began to farm and plant on their own fields. 

If you're teaching Level 2 students who have no trouble using the three categories of transitions just described, introduce them to two other kinds of transitions: change of direction and emphasis. 

**Change-of-Direction Transitions**

Change-of-direction transitions introduce contrasting thoughts. They are important signals to use in compare-and-contrast as well as in argumentative writing. 

Remind students that some change-of-direction transitions, such as *although* and *even though*, need to be used as subordinating conjunctions that introduce a dependent clause, not a sentence. For example, “Although zoos are popular attractions, critics believe they are cruel to the animals.” 

**Level 1 Example**

The zebra is related to a horse. However, ***they are not the same species*****. **

or

The zebra is related to a horse. ***However, *** they are not the same species. 

**Level 2 Example**

Red blood cells carry nutrients throughout the body. In contrast, ***white blood cells fight infection*****. **

or

Red blood cells carry nutrients throughout the body. ***In contrast, *** white blood cells fight infection. 

**Emphasis Transitions**

Emphasis transitions can be introduced at the same time as change-of-direction transitions. They prove a point or statement or reaffirm something the writer has already stated. They are often used in argumentative and opinion writing, letters of complaint, and formal requests. These transitions can also be used as conclusion transitions. 





Consider giving Level 1 students only the following transitions: *in addition, most importantly, in particular*. 

**Level 1 Example**

Helen liked to read in Braille. In particular, ***she loved the book*** *Little Women*. 

or

Helen liked to read in Braille. ***In particular, *** she loved the book *Little Women*. 

**Level 2 Example**

This example assumes students have read *The Crucible*.14

Dozens of people in Salem are accused of witchcraft. Notably, ***Rebecca Nurse and John Proctor, highly respected members of the***

***community, are accused*****. **

or

Dozens of people in Salem are accused of witchcraft. ***Notably, *** Rebecca Nurse and John Proctor, highly respected members of the community, are accused. 

**Mix It Up: Using Transitions from Different Categories**

After students have become familiar with different categories of transitions, you can have them choose from among several types. The following examples show transitions from the time-and-sequence, illustration, and conclusion categories. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Connect the following sentences using the given transition words. 

In addition For example

Specifically As a result

1. Augustus Caesar introduced many economic reforms. ***In addition, *** he focused attention on political and social issues. 

2. The rule of Augustus improved the status of women. ***Specifically, *** women had rights and could own property. 

3. Roman engineers made major changes within the Roman Empire. ***For example, *** the engineers paved streets and designed sewage systems. 

4. Augustus Caesar's reforms were a great success. ***As a result, *** Rome experienced over 200 years of peace and prosperity. 

If students have been reading *Jumanji*, 15 you might give them the following activity. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the second sentence following the transition word. 

1. Many scary things happened while Judy and Peter played *Jumanji*. Specifically, ***a lion tried to attack Peter*****. **

2. *Jumanji* came with specific instructions. For example, ***the first player to reachthe end must yell “Jumanji” to win and end***

***the game*****. **

3. Monkeys tore apart the kitchen. Then, ***a monsoon came*****. **

4. A rhinoceros stampede came through the living room. Also, ***a python wrapped itself around the fireplace*****. **

**Differentiating Transition Activities**

If some of your students need more support than others in using transitions, you can give them a word bank of possible transitions—or tell them what category of transition they need to supply and have them consult Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases.” 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

**BE CAREFUL**

You may find that your students fill in the blank after a transition word with a fragment rather than a complete sentence. If that happens, tell them to cover up the transition word and make sure that the rest of the sentence can stand alone. 





**Appositives: Another Name for a Noun**

**WHY PRACTICE APPOSITIVE ACTIVITIES? **

Provides the third strategy for creating topic and concluding sentences

Familiarizes students with a form that is often seen in text and rarely heard in spoken language

Enables students to vary sentence structure

Enables students to add information and complexity to a sentence

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Provides a check for comprehension

Encourages careful reading

An **appositive** is a second noun, or a phrase or clause equivalent to a noun, that is placed beside another noun to explain it more fully. For example: One World Trade Center, the tallest building in New York City, is also known as the Freedom Tower. 

In this example, “the tallest building in New York City” is the appositive. 

An appositive usually follows the noun it describes, as in the previous example, but it can also precede it:

The tallest building in New York City, One World Trade Center, is also known as the Freedom Tower. 

Students may have trouble grasping the concept of appositives. They may confuse them with **relative clauses**, which begin with *who, that, which,* *where, or when*, and include a verb—a construction more likely to be found in spoken language. For example: One World Trade Center, which is the tallest building in New York City, is also known as the Freedom Tower. 

It may be helpful for your students to know that most appositives begin with *a*, *an*, or *the*. 

To help students identify the appositive in a sentence, tell them that it's a phrase that can be removed or covered up without making the entire sentence incomplete. If we omitted the phrase “the tallest building in New York City” in the first example about the World Trade Center, we would still have a complete sentence:

One World Trade Center is also known as the Freedom Tower. 

Use your judgment about whether your students are ready to learn about appositives. In our experience, they should not be introduced before the middle of third grade or beginning of fourth grade. 

Before teaching your students appositive activities, be sure to give them an explanation of the purpose appositives serve. For example, you could say that appositives:

always follow or come before a noun and help to describe it further; 

further define or describe a person, place, or thing; 

are set off by commas if they appear in the middle of a sentence; and

can help them create more effective topic and concluding sentences because they give the reader more information. 

**Adding an appositive is the third strategy for creating topic and concluding sentences (see Exhibit 4.4****). **

**Exhibit 4.4** Three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences

The most effective way to introduce students to appositives is the following sequence:

1. Identify appositives. 

2. Match appositives. 

3. Fill in appositives. 

4. Brainstorm appositives. 

5. Given an appositive, write a sentence. 

6. Given a topic, write a sentence with an appositive. 

**1. Identify Appositives**

Give students examples of sentences containing appositives and have them underline them. Remember that for these activities, an appositive should not include a verb. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Underline the appositive in the sentence. 

Louis XIV, ***an absolute monarch of France***, built the Palace of Versailles as a symbol of royal power. 

**2. Match Appositives**

You can create a matching activity based on a text your class has been studying. For example, if your class has been reading *Flowers for Algernon*, 16

you could list the major characters on the left side of the sheet and a noun phrase that describes each of them on the other—not in the same order, of course. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Match each noun with the appositive that best describes it. 

1. *** b *** Alice Kinnian a. a white mouse

2. *** e *** Dr. Strauss

b. Charlie's teacher

3. *** d *** Burt Seldon c. a professor of psychology

4. *** a *** Algernon

d. a graduate student

5. *** c *** Dr. Nemur

e. a neurosurgeon

**3. Fill In Appositives**

Next, you can have your students fill in blanks with appositives in sentences that you create. For students who may not be able to insert an appositive independently, a word bank will help them choose the appropriate one. 

The following example assumes students have read *A Raisin in the Sun*. 17

**DIRECTIONS:** Use an appositive to complete each sentence. 

1. Beneatha thinks George Murchison, ***a wealthy classmate***, is not marriage material. 

2. Ruth, ***Travis's mother***, wants her son to be independent and responsible. 

3. Beneatha met Asagai, ***a student from Nigeria***, on her college campus. 

4. Asagai brings Beneatha a gift, ***robes from Nigeria***. 

**4. Brainstorm Appositives**

Have students suggest appositives for a particular topic. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm appositives for the given topic. 

**TOPIC:** Marie Curie

***a famous physicist***

***winner of the Nobel Prize***

***a renowned chemist***

***a Polish scientist***

***an inventor***

***the scientist who discovered radium***

**5. Given an Appositive, Write a Sentence**

Given an appositive for a topic your class has been studying, have students write a sentence incorporating that appositive. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence using the given appositive. 

a Greek city-state

***Athens, a Greek city-state, valued education and democracy. ***

a great philosopher

***Socrates, a Greek philosopher, created a method of questioning. ***

a series of contests

***The Olympics, a series of contests, were held in honor of the Greek gods. ***

**6. Given a Topic, Write a Sentence with an Appositive**

**DIRECTIONS:** For each topic, write a sentence using an appositive. 

natural selection

***Natural selection, a process of evolution, results in species with favorable traits*****. **

artificial selection

***Artificial selection, a process carried out by humans, is used to replicate favorable traits*****. **

**Out of Many, One: Sentence‑Combining**

**WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-COMBINING? **

Teaches grammar and usage

Encourages students to produce more compound and complex sentences

Enables students to see various options for crafting sentences

Exposes students to varied writing structures and enhances syntactic flexibility

Improves fluency in writing

Sentence-combining involves giving students a series of short declarative sentences and having them find various ways of combining those sentences into one longer, compound or complex sentence. Extensive research has found it to be a highly effective way of teaching grammar. It also gives students greater control over **syntax**, which is the way words are put together and ordered in sentences.18

If you've taught your students how to use conjunctions, appositives, and subordinating conjunctions, they'll be able to draw on those techniques in finding ways to combine sentences. They'll also be able to practice using pronouns. 

To introduce students to sentence-combining, give them a series of short, declarative sentences that can be combined into one longer, complex sentence. Begin with just two or three sentences, adding more as students' skills develop. 

For example, you could give your students the following short sentences:

Tania took the subway every day. 

Tania did not like the subway. 

Tania needed to get to work. 

There are a variety of ways these sentences could be combined into one longer sentence. You could, for example, put the second sentence first and introduce it with a subordinating conjunction. 

Although Tania did not like the subway, she took it every day because she needed to get to work. 

You could also begin with the second sentence and use basic conjunctions to connect it to the other two. 

*Tania didn't like the subway, but she took it every day because she needed to get to work*. 

Once students feel comfortable with the concept of sentence-combining, it's time to start embedding the activity in the content you're teaching. 

**Level 1 Example**

This example assumes students have read *Fourth Grade Rats*.19

**DIRECTIONS:** Combine the given sentences in one sentence. 

Joey stopped wearing tattoos. 

Joey stopped acting like a rat. 

***Joey stopped wearing tattoos and acting like a rat. ***

**Level 2 Example**

If you've been teaching your students about two of the ancient civilizations of India, you could give them the following sentences to combine:



**DIRECTIONS:** Combine the given sentences in one sentence. 

Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were twin cities. 

Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa used urban planning. 

The cities had a system of plumbing. 

***Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were twin cities that used urban planning and had a system of plumbing. ***

Students may not need knowledge of the content to engage in sentence-combining activities. In the preceding example, even if you've never heard of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, you can create a complex sentence because you've been given all the information you need in the simple sentences. 

Since it doesn't necessarily require students to retrieve information from long-term memory, sentence-combining may not be as powerful in reinforcing and deepening knowledge as some other TWR activities. 

However, sentence-combining activities are still a good use of students' time. In some cases, they will need to draw on their knowledge of the topic to combine the simple sentences effectively, and they will always be reinforcing their knowledge of grammar and syntax. 

**Using Sentence Activities to Teach Grammar and Conventions**

As TWR's Principle 5 states, grammar is best taught in the context of student writing. In fact, for many students, that's probably the *only* way they'll learn to use the grammar and conventions of written English. And sentence activities are the most effective vehicle for teaching those skills. If you wait until students are writing paragraphs and compositions, the number of mechanical errors can be overwhelming for you and for your students. 

Naturally, we don't expect students to master all the conventions of written English at once, but there's no reason to hold off on gradually introducing the fundamentals. 

If you're working with Level 1 students, you may need to start by teaching them to begin each sentence with a capital letter and end it with a period. 

As your students progress, you can introduce the use of question marks and exclamation points. Once they have a grasp of those conventions, you can begin to focus on the capitalization of proper nouns. 

When introducing students to the first subordinating conjunctions they'll encounter— *before*, *after*, *if*, and *when*—show them that the comma should go after the dependent clause. For example:

*After it stops raining, I'm going to take a walk*. 

In addition to giving students examples of sentences like these, you'll also need to ensure that they're placing commas correctly in their own writing. 

**BE CAREFUL**

Be careful not to overload Level 1 students with grammatical terms. It can become confusing and overwhelming to try to learn these terms while they are also thinking about spelling, sentence structure, and word choice. They can practice applying correct grammar and conventions without necessarily learning their labels. 

TWR's method does teach certain grammatical terms, such as *appositive*, that are useful as a kind of shorthand for concepts that are key parts of the method. If you want to suggest a specific way of varying sentence structure, it's easier to say “Try adding an appositive” than “Try adding a phrase describing the noun.” 

But TWR doesn't teach grammatical terms just for the sake of teaching them. For example, the method doesn't require teaching the concept of a prepositional phrase, which is a construction students are likely to be using naturally. 

**Weave It In: Integrating Sentence Activities into Daily Instruction**

Given that the ability to craft a good sentence is the necessary foundation for all good writing, it's important to offer as many opportunities as possible for students to practice writing sentences, even after they have progressed to writing paragraphs and compositions. In addition, **sentence** **activities can be powerful boosts to students' understanding and retention of content. ** If students have already learned how to use appositives, for example, constructing them in the context of new material will both provide a review of the grammatical concept and help students understand and remember the new material. 

Once you and your students have become acquainted with various TWR sentence activities, you'll find there are many ways to use them in your classroom—no matter the grade level or the subject you're teaching. A few possibilities are outlined here. 

At the beginning of class, you can give students a do-now to review material you've taught previously. 

Although Egyptians built the pyramids, 

Mid-lesson, you may want to pause and have students do a **stop-and-jot** by asking them to develop a question about what they've learned so far. 

You could also have students **turn-and-talk** to complete a *because-but-so* activity. 

Egyptians built pyramids because

Egyptians built pyramids, but

Egyptians built pyramids, so

At the end of class, consider having students fill in an exit slip responding to highlights in the lesson. 

Egyptians built pyramids. As a result, 

As a quiz, you can ask students to complete the following activities:

Write a sentence using this appositive: *huge monuments in the Egyptian desert*. 

or

Write a sentence with an appositive about the topic of *Egyptian pyramids*. 

If you weave these kinds of sentence-level activities into your instruction on a daily basis, you'll be giving your students the tools they need to create effective paragraphs and compositions, while at the same time boosting their understanding of the content you're teaching. 

**To Sum Up**

Familiarize students with the four sentence types—statement, command, question, and exclamation—to equip them to vary their sentence structure and provide the first strategy for creating effective topic and concluding sentences. 

Have students develop questions about texts or pictures to spur them to read closely and deepen their content knowledge. 

Give students sentence-stem activities with *because, but, * and *so* to enable them to think critically and to use and understand more complex sentences in their writing and reading. 

Have students practice beginning sentences with subordinating conjunctions ( *although*, *since*, etc.) to familiarize them with the syntax used in written language, help them extend their responses, and give them a second strategy for constructing topic and concluding sentences. 

Have students practice using the various types of transition words to signal the connections between their ideas and create smoothly flowing prose. 

Introduce students to appositives to help them give a reader more information and provide a third strategy for creating effective topic and concluding sentences. 

Have students practice sentence-combining to teach grammar and conventions and to help them create compound and complex sentences using varied structures. 

Embed sentence activities in the content you're teaching as much as possible to check students' comprehension and deepen their understanding.
