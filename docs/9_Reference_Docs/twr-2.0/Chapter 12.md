# CHAPTER 12

**Revolutionizing Learning: Embedding Writing Activities into Content**

Throughout this book we've given you reminders that unless you're introducing a new TWR strategy, writing activities and assignments should be embedded in the content you're teaching. If you're teaching about the Aztec Empire, for example, your writing activities, including sentence-level work, should be about the Aztec Empire. When you adapt TWR strategies to your particular content, you will be drawing on and reinforcing knowledge of the material your students have been reading and discussing.

It's also far more effective to weave writing into regular instruction and embed it in curricular content than to teach it in a separate writing block.

Rather than having to transfer skills they've acquired while writing about something that has nothing to do with the curriculum—a transfer that often doesn't happen—your students will be developing skills and content knowledge simultaneously. **Writing isn't just a skill. Writing instruction** **can also be a powerful tool for teaching content. **

Keep in mind that the _content_ of TWR activities is what drives their rigor: the same strategy can challenge students at different grade levels, depending on the content. For example, if you've been teaching kindergarteners about butterflies, you might have them do a _because-but-so_ activity orally on caterpillars and cocoons. If you're teaching an AP American History class, you can also give your high school students a _because-but-so_ activity—but you'll have them do it in written form and focus on the effectiveness of the New Deal. The format of the exercise is the same, but the latter activity is obviously far more rigorous.

Similarly, the principles of organizing and planning Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs) don't differ significantly from one grade level or ability level to another. It's the content that makes the task more challenging.

**Using Strategies Concurrently**

One way to have students keep practicing strategies you've already taught is to bring in several different strategies while teaching a single book or topic. This is, in fact, the optimal way to use the strategies once your students have become familiar with several of them.

The following examples illustrate how to use this approach with Level 1 and Level 2 students. In both cases, the strategies help students develop their writing or prewriting skills while simultaneously deepening their understanding of content.

**Level 1 Examples**

If your class has read _Henry's Freedom Box_, 1 consider the following activity:

Henry didn't know his birthday because **_no one kept records of enslaved people's birthdays. _**

Henry got married and had three children, but **\*his family was separated and sold\*\*\***. \*\*

Henry survived his journey in the small crate for 27 hours. As a result, **_he arrived in Philadelphia where he finally could be free. _**

You could also have students develop a Single-Paragraph Outline:

T.S. **\*Henry's Freedom Box, a true story, has won many awards\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_Richmond VA / sep from mother/ worked in factory_**

2. **_marries → 3 children / family sold_**

3. **_mails himself in small crate / 27 hrs. _**

4. **_in Philadelphia Henry a free man_**

C.S. **\*Henry was brave and determined in spite of terrible struggles\*\*\***. \*\*

**Level 2 Examples**

If your class has been studying Sumer, Babylon, and Hammurabi, you might give them the following _because-but-so_ activity—shown with possible student responses:

Hammurabi created a written code of laws because **_he wanted to impose order on Babylon. _**

Hammurabi created a written code of laws, but **_many Babylonians couldn't read them. _**

Hammurabi created a written code of laws, so **_there was a decrease in crime. _**

You could also have students develop test questions about the content using expository terms:

1. **_Explain the purpose of a written code of laws. _**

2. **_Enumerate the reasons for creating a code of laws. _**

3. **_Describe how social class influenced punishments. _**

Next, you could give your students sentence stems beginning with subordinating conjunctions and have them develop complete sentences, as in the following examples:

If Hammurabi had not developed a written code of laws, **_he would have failed to unite Babylonia. _**

Although Sumer's city-states were defeated, **_the Babylonian Empire adopted many of their ideas and practices. _**

If students have been introduced to SPOs, have them complete an SPO. More able students can go on to convert the outline into a paragraph.

T.S. **_Sumer, an ancient Mesopotamian civilization, is lauded for the lasting impact of its innovations. _**

1. **_cuneiform = system of writing/maps & sci info_**

2. **_# system → basis today for measuring time_**

3. **_architectural structures (arches, columns, ramps)_**

4. **_written code of laws_**

C.S. **_The contributions of Sumer had a major influence on later civilizations. _**

**Using TWR Strategies to “Revolutionize” Your Materials**

Most textbooks and other instructional materials provide end-of-chapter or end-of-unit comprehension questions that don't reflect TWR strategies.

Usually, you'll be able to draw on your knowledge of TWR's method to make those activities more powerful and reinforce the writing instruction you've been providing. Here are some Level 1 and 2 examples.

**Level 1 Examples**

If your class has read _The Cricket in Times Square_, 2 they may have been asked to complete an activity like this one: **Original Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.

1. Why was Chester worried about being in New York City?

2. What did Tucker do to make him feel better?

3. Where did Tucker take Chester?

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the sentences using _because, but_, and _so_.

Chester was worried about being in New York City because

Chester was worried about being in New York City, but

Chester was worried about being in New York City, so

If your class has been learning about rainforest animals and plants, they may have been asked to complete an activity like this one: **Original Activity**

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence.

T.S. **_Rainforest animals and plants interact in many ways that are important for maintaining a balanced ecosystem. _**

1.

2.

3.

4.

**Level 2 Example**

After studying different types of subatomic particles, students were asked the following questions:

**DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.

1. What types of subatomic particles does an atom contain?

2. Why are electrons attracted to positive objects?

3. How do protons behave?

4. What does neutral mean?

The teacher “revolutionized” the questions in the following way:

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the second sentence following the transition word.

1. An atom contains three types of subatomic particles. Specifically,

2. Electrons have a negative charge. As a result,

3. Protons repel each other. However,

4. The neutron is neutral. In other words,

**How to Use TWR to Differentiate Your Instruction**

Most classrooms encompass a range of student ability—sometimes a wide range. One of the most challenging aspects of teaching is accommodating all of those levels without going over some students' heads while boring others.

**Keep an Eye Out for Struggling Students**

As we've demonstrated throughout this book, TWR activities easily lend themselves to differentiation. It's not necessary to come up with a completely different version of the activities or use different content for students of varying abilities—in fact, that approach risks leaving struggling students permanently behind. What's important is that you have a clear idea of what students are supposed to be learning and activities that will give you a good sense of whether all students have mastered it. 3

**Modify the Same Strategy for Students at Different Levels**

We've described throughout this book how you can differentiate many of the strategies as we've introduced them. But to recap, here are some examples:

**Sentence expansion. ** Ask fewer question words of students who are having difficulty. For example, give all students a kernel such as “They rebelled,” but ask some students _who, when, why, _ and _where_ while asking others only _who_ and _when_.

**Because-but-so. ** Give all students the same stem—for example, “The British invaded the colonies”—but ask some students to provide complete sentences for all three conjunctions while asking others to write a sentence for only one or two conjunctions.

**Appositives. ** Ask all students to supply an appositive to describe a person, place, or thing, but give some students a list of words and phrases to choose from.

**Sentence-combining. ** Give all students a group of short sentences to combine into one longer one, but provide some students with fewer sentences to combine.

**Unelaborated paragraph revision. ** Give all students the same bare-bones paragraph, but give some students fewer instructions on how to revise it. For example, you might give some students a list of six things to do and limit others to only one or two, such as “Improve T.S. and C.S.”

**SPOs. ** Have all students complete an SPO, but provide some students with the topic or the concluding sentence while asking others to come up with those sentences independently. You might also require some students to use only key words and phrases for their notes on the dotted lines, while others use abbreviations and symbols as well.

**TOs or MPOs. ** Have all students complete a TO or MPO, but provide some students with the categories they'll need to organize their paragraphs while having others come up with their own categories.

**MPOs. ** When students are converting an MPO into a draft, you can also provide some students with the general or specific statements to include in their introduction and conclusion.

**To Sum Up**

By weaving TWR activities into regular instruction and embedding them in curricular content, you'll be able to use writing instruction as a powerful teaching tool.

Use several strategies concurrently while teaching any topic.

Differentiate TWR activities for students who are struggling or are racing ahead, without altering the basic form of the activity or using different content.

Transform open-ended questions in your instructional materials into more focused activities using strategies from The Writing Revolution.

## BOOK DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. **Choose a topic (e.g., a science topic, book chapter, current event) and devise activities on that topic for your grade level** **using: \*because, but\*\*\***, and \*so**\***; sentence expansion; subordinating conjunctions; and an SPO, TO, or MPO. \*\*

2. **Why do the TWR strategies assess student comprehension more accurately than typical end-of-unit textbook questions? **
