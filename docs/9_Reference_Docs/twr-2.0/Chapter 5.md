## CHAPTER 5

**Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What's to Come**

Ms. Allen, a seventh-grade ELA teacher, noticed that whenever she asked her students to produce a written response to a prompt, certain things were bound to happen. 

Some students just put their heads down on their desks, seeming to give up before they had even started. 

Others would start scribbling industriously, raising Ms. Allen's hopes. But when she collected their papers, she was usually disappointed to find pages of disorganized thoughts, often barely understandable. 

And then there was Tyler. Normally good-humored and likable, Tyler seemed to undergo a personality transformation when he was asked to write. He would leave his seat and start poking other students, disrupting the entire class and ignoring Ms. Allen's requests that he sit down. 

At times, he would simply take an extended bathroom break, returning only after the time allotted for the writing assignment was over. 

Eventually, Ms. Allen realized that Tyler wasn't just misbehaving. He was desperate to avoid revealing his inability to write. The students who put their heads down on their desks were less disruptive, but they felt the same way. And the others who produced pages of unintelligible prose? They didn't even realize they weren't able to write coherently. 

Ms. Allen wondered how students could get to seventh grade without knowing how to write a paragraph, let alone an essay. Everyone expected them to have already acquired those skills. If they hadn't, they felt they were failures—and for some kids, like Tyler, that painful feeling led them to act out. 

Students like those in Ms. Allen's classroom *can* learn to write effective paragraphs and essays if they're taught how to plan carefully first. 

If you're about to embark on a road trip, try a new recipe, develop a football play—or engage in just about any complex, multi-step task—you need to have a plan. Without one, it is far more likely that your efforts will be disappointing at best and end in failure at worst. Yet, when we teach our students to write in lengthier forms such as paragraphs and compositions, we don't often help them come up with the kind of plan they need to produce an effective piece of writing. 

Some people say that planning will constrain students' creativity. To the contrary, we've found that teaching students to plan can actually *enhance* their creativity. If students are working from a plan, they're liberated from the need to figure out the overall structure of what they're writing as they go along. As a result, they have the mental space they need to conjure up vivid imagery or relevant details. 

True, some authors prefer to simply free-write as a first step in their writing process, allowing their thoughts to take them where they will. But that approach doesn't work for most students, for at least two reasons. First, most students are not experienced writers. They may still be struggling with figuring out everything from punctuation or word choice to larger questions such as the overall organization of their thoughts. If they're asked to plunge into a longer piece of writing with no outline to follow, they'll need to juggle all these tasks at once. As we explained in Chapter 1, they're likely

to be overwhelmed. 

Second, the free-writing approach to drafting is best suited to relatively free-form genres such as memoirs, poems, plays, short stories, or (perhaps) novels. That's not the kind of writing most of us are expected to produce in college or the workplace. What we are asked to do, in countless situations, 

is to explain, inform, justify, enumerate, summarize, and describe. (A comprehensive list of these expository writing terms can be found in Appendix

A.)

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

Even many experienced writers find planning to be essential if they're going to communicate effectively. As compared to more creative forms of writing, explanatory, argumentative, and analytical pieces demand that authors figure out in advance where they're going to end up and chart a clear and logical course that will lead a reader there. 

As a classic writing handbook points out, “planning must be a deliberate prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.” 1

In short, if you want your students to be able to move from writing effective sentences to writing coherent paragraphs—and, ultimately, compositions

—you'll need to teach them how to plan before they write, using the linear outlines that we present in Chapters 6 and 9. As with revising—which we'll turn to in Chapter 7—planning/outlining is a stage of writing that rarely receives enough instructional time and attention. 

**Offloading the Cognitive Burden: Why Planning Is Crucial**

Why is it so important for students to plan before they write? Largely because of the demands that writing places on **executive functions, ** which are cognitive processes that enable us to plan, monitor, and successfully achieve our goals. They are housed primarily in the prefrontal cortex of the brain and enable us to perform a series of actions that are essential to good writing. The abilities associated with executive functions begin to develop in early childhood, but they don't reach their peak until we are in our mid-20s. That means that virtually all students in kindergarten through twelfth grade are working with executive function abilities that are still a work in progress. 

When assigning writing tasks, teachers need to be keenly aware of the demands they place on a student's executive functions, including working memory. These functions enable a writer to do the following tasks:

**Strategize. ** For beginning or less experienced writers, the teacher, not the student, selects the topic. Selecting a topic demands the ability to foresee consequences. A topic shouldn't be so narrow that there is too little material to write about. If the topic is too broad, a great deal of skill is needed to sort essential from non-essential information. 

**Initiate a series of actions. ** After a topic is selected, students need to find textual evidence to support a topic sentence or thesis statement. 

**Outline. ** Students must be able to develop an outline that provides a road map for presenting a body of information, an explanation, or an argument. When students plan by creating an outline, they will have more cognitive resources to devote to tasks like self-monitoring and instituting needed changes. 

**Organize. ** Students need to sequence information in the outline in the order that suits a particular piece of writing, whether it's a narrative, an argument, or a comparison of two or more different things. 

**Resist distractions. ** The typical classroom and home are full of potential distractions, and the modern era—with its screens and ubiquitous internet connections—seems to have made students' attention spans shorter than ever. 

**Sustain effort. ** Students must maintain the stamina necessary to focus on the writing task at hand. 

**Self-monitor. ** When working on a draft, students need to continually assess it to ensure they're not going off track. They must be able to identify non-essential, less essential, and essential information. 

**Institute needed changes. ** Although students can make changes while creating an outline, most often they will do so while writing or revising a draft. Changes can range from reorganizing an entire sequence of ideas to executing smaller modifications such as choosing more accurate words, varying sentence structure, and inserting transitions. 

A key component of executive functioning is working memory, the aspect of our consciousness where we try to make sense of new information. As we discussed in Chapter 2, writing places a heavy burden on working memory—a burden that scientists call cognitive load. Depending on the topic, even

constructing sentences can impose a heavy cognitive load on inexperienced writers. Writing at length only increases that load, and it can impose a significant burden even if students have good sentence-level skills. Yet students who are still struggling with the basics of writing, at all grade levels, are frequently asked to compose not only paragraphs but entire essays. 

Teachers need to be aware that executive functions are compromised by attention deficit disorders and stress. Stress can be caused by many factors, and nearly all students experience it to some extent. Those who are most likely to experience the levels of stress that interfere with executive functions include students who have language and learning disabilities, those who are still learning English, and those who live in chronically stressful conditions, such as those associated with poverty. Students who are under a great deal of pressure to succeed or who have suffered loss also can experience significant stress. 

However, writing—and especially composing lengthy writing assignments—is such a complex activity that virtually *all* students will experience some level of stress while engaging in it. That's why it's particularly important for them to have a clear, written plan before they begin writing at length. 

Such a plan enables writers to “offload” some of the burden that writing at length imposes on working memory. 2

**TEACHER TIP**

Students can and should learn to plan and outline paragraphs as a whole class even while they're becoming familiar with the various sentence-level skills described in this book. Inexperienced writers can learn a lot from outlining, both about the topic at hand and about how to organize ideas logically when they are guided to do so. However, students shouldn't be expected to outline, draft, and revise longer writing independently until they've acquired the sentence-level skills they need to do so. 

**Identifying Topic, Audience, and Purpose**

To plan a paragraph or a composition, your students need to understand three things: the topic they're writing about, the readers they're trying to communicate with, and the reason they're writing. Initially, you'll need to lead them in class discussions since most students will find it difficult to identify these elements on their own. 

**Choosing a Topic**

It's best to choose a topic that is part of the core curriculum and that students have already learned something about. 

Sometimes students are expected to follow a separate writing curriculum that provides little information about the topics they're supposed to write about. However, it's virtually impossible to write about a topic you know little or nothing about. 

Students are also often asked to write about their personal experiences or opinions—for example, an essay on whether the cafeteria should serve chocolate milk. While students may have the knowledge to engage in that kind of writing, they miss out on the opportunity to use writing to build and deepen their knowledge. 



Even when choosing topics from the core curriculum, it's crucial to determine if students have enough background knowledge about the topic before they begin the planning process. If students need more information, class discussions should help them acquire it or help them identify the best sources to provide it. Students need *some* knowledge to begin planning a piece of writing, but in the process, they may identify gaps in their knowledge and they may take the opportunity to fill those gaps. 

**Determining the Audience**

One of the more challenging aspects of writing for many students is to imagine themselves in the mind of an intended reader. They may struggle to anticipate what that reader would need or want to know and modify their writing accordingly. For example, a paragraph describing Washington, DC, that's directed at an audience of first-time tourists will be very different from one aimed at people who already live or work there. 

Of course, in the context of the classroom, the audience is primarily you, the teacher—and ideally, you'll know at least as much about the topic as your students. But students need to be reminded that in some situations they'll need to tailor the structure, facts, word choice, and arguments in their writing to the kinds of readers they're planning to reach. Even though their teacher may know a lot about the topic, it's important for students to learn how to write for other audiences who don't. 

For example, older students can imagine they're writing about a topic relating to climate change for an audience of third graders. Then have them imagine writing about the same topic for an audience of climate-change skeptics. Would they choose different language? Would they need to explain more information for one group as opposed to another? Would they make different points? 

The intended audience will also determine the tone a writer adopts. Your tone is likely to be different if you're addressing someone you know well as opposed to someone else. On the left in Exhibit 5.1 is an example of a note that I wrote to my husband while dashing out the door, and the example

on the right is a note that I wrote to a friend who was staying with us. 

**Exhibit 5.1**

In most cases, students should adopt a fairly formal tone in their writing assignments since that's the tone they'll usually be expected to take in college and in the workplace. 

Writing prompts and test questions may not specify the audience students should have in mind. In that case, students should generally assume that the reader is someone without a great deal of specific information about the topic. 

Sometimes the prompts themselves will define how much information students need to provide. If a prompt reads “*Summarize* the plot of *Animal* *Farm*,” students will need to relate the key points of the entire plot as if the audience knows nothing about it. If, on the other hand, a prompt reads

“*Analyze* Squealer's role on the farm,” students should focus only on that aspect of the novel. 

**Understanding the Purpose**

Are students trying to persuade the reader to adopt a certain position, or are they simply narrating a series of events? The purpose of a piece of writing influences many of the choices students will make in planning it. A paragraph that is intended to persuade a reader usually has a different kind of topic sentence than one that is describing a situation, place, or person. Similarly, the concluding sentence of a persuasive piece of writing might be a call to action rather than a summary of what's been said. 

Writers will also organize details differently depending on their purpose. If they're writing about a series of events or a process, it will make sense to narrate them in chronological order. But if they're trying to persuade a reader to adopt a particular point of view, they will probably want to begin with their “soft” arguments and end with their strongest. 





**RESOURCE**

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

The language you use when creating a writing prompt or posing a question for students can signal the particular purpose of the writing you're looking

for, so acquaint your students with the various expository terms and their meanings (see Appendix A). For example, if you ask them to *justify* something, this means the purpose of their writing is argumentative. If you're teaching Level 2 students, you might use some of the following expository terms to help students identify the purpose of a writing assignment:

**Contrast** the candidate's positions with those of his opponent. 

**Summarize** the plot of *The Scarlet Letter*. 

**Discuss** the symbolism in the setting of *Lord of the Flies*. 

**Analyze** the relationship between Finny and Gene in *A Separate Peace*. 

Even younger Level 1 students can practice responding to some of the expository terms. For example:

**Explain** why Mr. Falker was a good teacher. 

**Discuss** why the disappearance of sea ice is affecting penguins. 

**Describe** the garden where Mary meets Ben. 

**Summarize** Chapter 2. 

**A Guide to Purpose: Three Types of Writing**

Identifying the purpose of a piece of writing determines much of the tone and organization of the paragraph or composition. 

To help students identify purpose in writing, TWR emphasizes three types of paragraphs and compositions: **expository**, **narrative, ** and **opinion** or **argumentative. ** In the real world, of course, a single piece of writing often contains more than one of these types at a time. But when students are first learning to write at length, they need practice with one type of writing at a time. Later, when they've become comfortable with the demands of each type, they can begin to blend them in the way experienced writers often do. 

**Expository Writing**

Classes in English, social studies, and science tend to generate assignments that require expository writing. Therefore, most of the time spent on writing instruction should be devoted to teaching students how to do it well. 

Expository writing may explore:

presenting a problem and a solution

analyzing a cause-and-effect relationship

providing a description or giving directions

comparing and contrasting two concepts, events, or individuals and drawing a conclusion based on the facts presented When introducing compare-and-contrast assignments, be aware that organizing those kinds of essays can challenge the skills of many writers. It can be even more difficult to write a single paragraph interweaving two points of view. 

**Narrative Writing**

Narrative writing relates a process, a biography, or event in chronological or sequential order, and is usually organized with transition words that signal time or sequence, such as *first*, *next*, *then*, *later*, and *finally* (see Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases”). In general, narratives are

written in either the first person (as a participant) or third person (as an observer). 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

Narrative writing involving fictional stories or personal experience is not the focus of the Hochman Method. Rather, the kind of narratives we cover might include summarizing a plot in English class, explaining the steps for solving a problem in math, tracing a process in science, enumerating the important milestones in a biography, or identifying what led up to a historic event in social studies. 

**Opinion Writing and Argumentative Writing**

We discuss opinion writing and argumentative writing in detail in Chapter 10, but we'll provide a brief overview of these types of writing here. 

Opinion writing, usually assigned to elementary students, seeks to change how the reader thinks or feels without providing evidence or opposing views. By contrast, argumentative writing presents both sides of an issue, appeals to logic, and gathers evidence and reasons for supporting one side or the other. The conclusion usually proposes the action or point of view that the writer would like the reader to take. 

Education experts consider argumentative writing the most complex and cognitively demanding form of composition.3 As they become more

experienced writers, students may be required to support their claims with evidence and weigh the pros and cons of each side. Perhaps most challenging, they must be able to accurately represent a position with which they may not agree, then take an opposing position and justify it to the reader. 

Most argumentative assignments are given in middle and high schools. Students might be asked to criticize an author's technique or to evaluate the importance of a historical event. But most state writing standards call for students to begin writing “opinion pieces” in the early elementary grades, so it's a good idea to begin instruction in this kind of writing earlier than middle school. 

However, it may be more difficult to find opinion and argumentative assignments for young children that are embedded in the content of the curriculum. If necessary, you might have to assign opinion pieces on non-curricular topics such as “Homework on Weekends.” But if a school is using

an elementary curriculum that is rich in content—and especially, in historical topics—it may well be possible to have students engage in curriculum-based opinion writing. 

Before your students begin to write an outline for an opinion or argumentative paragraph or composition, have them engage in class discussions about their topic. That kind of dialogue or debate can help them determine and refine their own opinions and formulate arguments that their intended audience would find persuasive. 

**To Sum Up**

Writing at length places heavy demands on the aspects of cognition known as executive functions and working memory. 

Before students can plan a piece of writing, they need to identify the topic, the audience, and the purpose. 

Encourage students to write for different audiences, possibly requiring them to alter their topic, their tone, and their word choice. 

As students acquire sentence-level skills, they can begin learning to outline, draft, and revise, BUT only as a whole-class activity. 

Introduce students to the meaning of expository terms such as *enumerate* and *justify* to help them understand the purpose of an assignment or a prompt. 

Provide assignments in the three types of writing: expository, narrative, and opinion or argumentative.
