## CHAPTER 9

**Moving On to Compositions: The Transition Outline and the Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

As spring rolled around, Ms. Hamilton knew her fifth graders would soon be expected to produce extended written responses to prompts on their end-of-year state reading tests. They would be asked to read a passage on a topic they might or might not be familiar with and to write at length in response to a prompt about that passage. 

In an effort to prepare them for the test, Ms. Hamilton had them read an article about the threat of extinction for the honeybee and write about the causes and effects of extinction. The results weren't encouraging. 

Ava wrote one long paragraph that basically repeated the same nugget of information—more or less verbatim from the text—over and over. 

Michael's response included a lot of information about the extinction of dinosaurs but had little to do with honeybees. Brandon related a number of details from the article but listed them in no particular order. And Trina—along with a number of other students—just put her head down on her desk, apparently too overwhelmed by the assignment to even try to come up with a response. 

Ms. Hamilton wasn't sure what to do. Was the test expecting too much of fifth graders—or at least of the fifth graders in her classroom? Or was there something missing from her teaching? Whatever the problem, in a few short weeks her kids would be expected to produce extended, coherent written responses to a prompt on a test. And she was pretty sure most weren't going to be able to do it. 

If writing is hard, then writing at length only makes it harder. One reason it's important to start writing instruction at the sentence level is that it lessens the heavy load that writing imposes on working memory, freeing up cognitive capacity. But even if students have learned how to construct good sentences, writing at length can still result in an overwhelming cognitive load. Writers may need to juggle many complex items in working memory—for example, keeping track of what they've already said or what they're planning to say next. That's why linear outlines are so important: they can “offload” some of that cognitive burden. 

As students reach higher grade levels, they're expected not only to write at length but also to write well about topics beyond their personal experience, which requires them to juggle that content in working memory along with the demands of writing. A heavy emphasis on personal narratives in the elementary grades often leaves students unprepared to meet those kinds of writing expectations in middle and high school. 

In response to that problem, many states have adopted standards requiring that students write at length and in a variety of genres beginning in the elementary grades—informational and opinion essays as well as narratives. No longer is it enough for a fourth grader to write a paragraph about his summer vacation or a trip to the zoo. The standards may require him to be able to write, for example, compositions that “introduce a topic or text clearly, state an opinion, and create an organizational structure in which related ideas are grouped to support the writer's purpose.” 1

While it's important to prepare younger students for the writing demands they'll encounter at higher grade levels, the standards tell us only where students need to end up without explaining how to get them there. Writing standards and assignments based on them are rarely grounded in realistic expectations of children's development, nor do they account for the heavy cognitive load that writing imposes on inexperienced writers of any age. 

When asked to write at length in an expository mode, students at all grade levels often struggle with sentence structure, organization, clarity, and coherence. Simply handing out longer and more challenging writing assignments doesn't magically give students the skills they need to create well-crafted compositions. 

A **composition** (essay) is a series of paragraphs united by a common theme. The characteristics of effective compositions mirror those of effective paragraphs:

**Structure. ** The paragraphs are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader. 

**Coherence. ** The paragraphs are logically connected with appropriate transition words. 

**Unity. ** Every paragraph supports the main idea or thesis of the composition. 

**Well-constructed sentences. ** The sentences within each paragraph are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures should vary (some simple, others compound or complex). 

Over the course of many years, my colleagues and I have analyzed countless compositions, research papers, and essays. After looking at both long-term assignments and timed responses to essay questions on tests, we realized that we needed a structured, sequenced method for guiding students to compose longer pieces of writing. A crucial component of that method is to explicitly teach students how to create a linear outline, building on what they've learned about outlining a paragraph. 

**The Benefits of Outlining**

**WHY PRACTICE OUTLINING FOR A COMPOSITION? **

Reveals gaps in knowledge or comprehension to both teachers and students

Develops organizational skills

Helps in categorizing information

Provides students with a logical sequence for expository, narrative, and argumentative text structures

Avoids repetition and irrelevant information

Promotes well-structured introductions and conclusions

Develops efficient note-taking skills

Strengthens the ability to create transitions between ideas and paragraphs

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Creating an outline will help your students cement knowledge they've already acquired and gather new information that builds on it. Once students are familiar with outlines and the associated skills, they'll be able to reproduce outlines on scratch paper during tests and use them to write clearer and more coherent responses. 

**It's important to remember that, as with the SPO, creating the outline is a powerful activity in itself, regardless of whether a** **student turns it into a draft or a finished product. ** And, as always, it's important to continue sentence-level activities while students are learning to create outlines for compositions. 





**The Transition Outline and Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

The Transition Outline (TO), shown in Exhibit 9.1, is designed for students who are ready to write more than one paragraph but not yet ready for the

task of writing complete introductions and conclusions. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Outline (TO),  *Appendix L*

A composition based on the TO begins with a single sentence, the **thesis statement**, and ends with a single sentence, the **concluding statement**. 

Typically, such one-sentence paragraphs are found only in fiction or journalistic writing. Nevertheless, we believe it's important to give students an easier option to introduce and conclude a subject before teaching them how to write more fully developed introductions and conclusions, which we'll describe later in this chapter. 

**RESOURCE**

Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO) *Appendix Q*

Some students may be ready to move directly to the more challenging Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO), shown in Exhibit 9.2, without first creating TOs.

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**



**Exhibit 9.2**

Students who are familiar with the SPO but not ready for the format of the TO or the MPO can use a Pre-Transition Outline (PTO). The format of the

PTO can be found later in this chapter, under “Adapting the TO and MPO: Pre-Transition Outline (PTO),” and in Appendix J. 



**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)  *Appendix J*

You will need to use your judgment about what your students are equipped to handle. In classes where there is a significant range of ability, you may decide to provide some students with the TO and others with the MPO, even if all are writing about the same content. 

**Prepping for the TO and MPO**

If you've given your students ample practice creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs), they will have already acquired some of the prerequisite skills needed for developing a TO on their own. Specifically, they will have learned how to:

Write supporting details in note form, using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols

Organize and categorize details

They'll also need to acquire two new skills:

Generating a thesis statement that summarizes the theme or main idea of an entire essay

Generating a concluding statement that rephrases the thesis statement

To construct these statements, students will draw on and extend the generalizing abilities they've acquired in summarizing and in composing topic and concluding sentences for the SPO. 

Similarly, when it's time to draft and revise a composition using the TO, students who have had experience writing paragraphs will already have acquired some of the skills they need:

Creating topic sentences

Using a variety of sentence structures

Connecting sentences with transition words and phrases

But they will also need to acquire some new skills through repeated practice, including:

Expanding their use of transition words and phrases to connect paragraphs as well as sentences

Learning how to smoothly incorporate quotations from text into their writing

Level 2 students who are ready to move on to drafting and revising compositions using the MPO will also need to acquire another, more challenging skill:

Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs that include not only a thesis statement but also at least two more sentences that provide a larger context for it

When you're introducing students to the TO or the MPO, it's best to base writing assignments on what students have studied previously or are currently learning, as long as they've had time to acquire a good deal of information about the topic. Advanced Level 2 writers can be assigned topics that require research. 

We'll begin by explaining how to guide students through the less complex TO process and then discuss how to teach the skills required for the MPO

to those Level 2 students who are ready to tackle it. Argumentative compositions, which are particularly challenging, will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. 

**Introducing Students to the TO**

Even after students are comfortable creating an SPO and using it to draft a paragraph, they may still need more support before they're ready for the tasks required to write sophisticated essays. It's not necessary to have them start with three paragraphs and then progress to four or five. The length of a composition should be determined by its topic and content. 

Be sure to spend a lot of time developing a TO with the whole class following the sequence illustrated in Exhibit 9.3. As with the SPO, outlines don't

necessarily have to be converted into drafts.

**Exhibit 9.3**

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING A TO**

1. Select a topic and identify the purpose of the composition. 

2. Write the thesis statement. 

3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the TO, with the abbreviation T.S. 

as a reminder to write a topic sentence. 

4. Write the details supporting the main idea in the right-hand column for each body paragraph. Use keywords, phrases, abbreviations, and symbols on the dotted lines. 

5. Write the concluding statement. 

Each step in this sequence is discussed in the following sections. 

**1. Selecting a Topic and Identifying the Purpose**

Students must know a topic well before they'll be able to create a TO about it. Book reports, current events related to scientific or geographic issues, and biographies are all good topics. 

The teacher, not the student, should select the topic for the TO, and—at least at first—all students should be writing on the same topic. Students will need practice before they can identify a topic on their own that's appropriate for a composition—one that's neither too narrow nor too broad. The Civil War, for example, is too broad, and a discussion of a specific minor battle might be too narrow. A review of the military career of Ulysses S. 

Grant or an analysis of the Battle of Gettysburg would work better. 

Although students at higher grade levels will be writing about more complex topics, they should not be expected to engage in independent research while learning how to construct a TO. That would impose too great a burden on working memory. 

After the topic has been chosen, guide students in identifying the purpose and the type of the composition. Will it be an expository, narrative, descriptive, or opinion essay? More advanced writers can combine these structures, but less experienced writers should stick to a single one. For background on these different types of essays, see the discussion in Chapter 5. 

**2. Developing a Thesis Statement**

A **thesis statement** is **a statement that conveys the main theme of the entire composition**—just as a topic sentence conveys the main idea of a single paragraph. A thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence at the top of the TO. **The thesis statement and concluding** **statement are the only complete sentences on the TO. **

Constructing a thesis statement requires that students understand the main points they will be making in a composition and the text structure they will adopt. At the same time, they'll need to be able to state their thesis in a single sentence—and one that is not too detailed. 

Tyrell wrote a thesis statement that may remind you of sentences composed by your own students:

***In this essay, I am going to tell you about the many effects of the Civil War*****. **

Tyrell reveals his topic, but it is not obvious exactly what he is going to tell us. 

Students may benefit from a thesis statement that explicitly outlines a **plan of development**. This means that the thesis statement presents the main points of the composition in the order in which they will be addressed in the composition. The plan of development provides a clear road map for the rest of the outline. 

With guidance, Tyrell rewrote his statement to include a plan of development:

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

Exhibit 9.4 is a TO showing Tyrell's thesis statement with a plan of development:  *economic*, *social*, *political*. Tyrell's thesis statement signals to the reader that the next paragraph of the essay will focus on the economic effects of the Civil War. Then there will be a paragraph on the social effects, and finally a paragraph on the political effects.

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**



**Exhibit 9.4**

When your students are first learning to create thesis statements, tell them they can draw on the three strategies for creating topic sentences that they've already learned:

**Statement:**

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

**Subordinating conjunction:**

***Although the Civil War lasted only four years, its impacts on the economic, social, and political structures of the United***

***States were enormous*****. **

**Appositive:**

***The Civil War, a turning point in the country's history, had major economic, social, and political effects*****. **

Students may choose not to include a plan of development, in which case they can experiment with different structures. For example, a thesis statement could simply say:

***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency marked the beginning of the United tates as a world power*****. **

The essay could then address the specifics—the Panama Canal, the Roosevelt Corollary—contained in that general idea. 

You may find it helpful to provide students with examples of different approaches they can use when developing their thesis statements: **A personal judgment:**

***It is urgent that problems associated with rising sea levels as a result of climate change be addressed worldwide*****. **

**Advice or directions:**

***There are several strategies to combat the effect of rising sea levels*****. **

**A statement of consequences (cause and effect):**

***If climate change is not addressed globally, coastal cities will be in danger*****. **

**An interpretation (usually of fiction or poetry):**

***John Knowles's widely read coming-of-age novel, A Separate Peace, presents themes of friendship, envy, and the effect of***

***social class on relationships*****. **

**Compare and contrast:**

***There are significant differences between the candidates regarding their positions on education*****. **

Even without a plan of development, students will be able to refer back to their thesis statement to stay on track. Every paragraph in the composition should relate to the theme contained in the thesis statement. 

**3. Developing the Main Idea Boxes**

The column on the left side of the TO is headed “Main Idea.” The Main Idea boxes are for words or phrases indicating the topic of each paragraph. 

Unlike the SPO, the TO does not require students to write out the topic sentences for their paragraphs. However, it can be helpful to have them write the abbreviation T.S. in each Main Idea box to remind them to include topic sentences for each paragraph when they compose their drafts. 

Listing the main ideas in the left-hand boxes helps students avoid repetition and ensures that each paragraph relates to the composition's overall theme. 

Different types of compositions call for different kinds of main ideas for the body paragraphs, as you can see from the following examples. The order and number of the paragraphs also will depend on the type of assignment.

**4. Developing the Details**

The Details boxes are on the right side of the outline. These boxes have dotted lines where students write notes using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols that will form the basis of their body paragraphs. Students should have sufficient background knowledge to provide at least three details for each paragraph. 

**Make sure students understand that they should write the details for each paragraph in note form rather than in full sentences. **

Although students need to settle on the order of the paragraphs when creating the TO, the order of the details may not matter at this point. Students can revise their outlines or change the order of the details when it's time to write their drafts. 

**5. Writing the Concluding Statement**

The function of a concluding statement is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. A concluding statement usually does one of the following:

Summarize

Offer a solution or recommendation

Pose a question

Justify a position

Present a point of view

Here are some examples of possible concluding statements, along with thesis statements for the same essays:

**EXAMPLE 1:**

**Thesis statement:**

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

**Concluding statement (summary):**

***In summary, the impact of the Civil War was felt for many years after the fighting ended*****. **

**EXAMPLE 2:**

**Thesis statement:**

***If climate change is not addressed worldwide, coastal cities will be in danger*****. **

**Concluding statement (solution or recommendation):**

***To conclude, nations must work together to prevent rising sea levels from causing widespread destruction*****. **

**EXAMPLE 3:**

**Thesis statement:**

***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency saw the development of the national parks*****. **

**Concluding statement:**

***One of Theodore Roosevelt's most important legacies was his approach to conservation*****. **



Students do not need to write concluding sentences for each paragraph in a multiple-paragraph composition. 

**Using a Transition Outline to Write an Essay**

Converting a TO into a draft should be an efficient process. Students will know what their topic is, the basics of what they want to say, and the order in which they want to say it. In the drafting and revising process, they can devote their mental energy to crafting clear, interesting, and varied sentences—including topic sentences for their body paragraphs—and using transitions to create a coherent and effective composition. 

When students revise their drafts, the benefits of continuing to work on sentence-level activities alongside lengthier writing become clear. Those activities will continue to help students remember to apply strategies like varying their sentence structure and including information their intended audience might need. Students may also need to cite evidence from texts and incorporate quotations. 

**Using Transitions to Link Paragraphs**

Transitions enhance coherence and flow in longer pieces of writing. When your students are converting TOs into drafts of compositions and revising them, remind them to use transitions to link one paragraph to the next. Virtually any of the transitions they've learned to connect sentences can also be used to connect paragraphs. See Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases.” 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

For example, if a student is writing a compare-and-contrast composition about red and white blood cells and she has written one paragraph about red

blood cells and the next about white blood cells, she can use a change-of-direction transition to create a link between the two paragraphs: *Red blood cells carry respiratory gases throughout the body. These cells lack a nucleus, which means that there is room inside each cell for more* *of a pigment called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their color and is responsible for carrying oxygen around the body. Red blood* *cells also transport carbon dioxide*. 

***On the other hand**, white blood cells fight infection. These cells circulate throughout the bloodstream and tissues to attack unknown* *organisms that may cause an illness or injury. Unlike red blood cells, white blood cells have a nucleus*. 

**Incorporating Quotations**

When students begin to write longer compositions, they are often encouraged not just to cite evidence from texts but also to quote from them directly. When students are creating outlines, they should be taught how to include the page number(s) and source(s) of the quotation(s) they plan to use. If they are using more than one source, they will need to include the author as well. 

Too frequently, students will use a quotation without providing any context, introduction, or attribution. In addition, it's often not clear why students have chosen a particular quotation. They may assume its meaning and relevance are obvious, or they may not have fully understood the words themselves. At times it seems that students are inserting a quotation simply to prove they've read the text rather than to support the point they're making. 

If you want your students to use quotations effectively, you have to show them how to be judicious about selecting the text they want to quote and how to incorporate that text smoothly into their own writing. They'll need to answer these questions:

*What does the quotation mean? *

*Whose words are they? *

*How does the quotation support the point I'm making? *

**Understanding the Quotation**

To ensure that students actually understand the words they're quoting, ask them to paraphrase the quotation for you. For example: Quotation: *“Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere.” *

Paraphrased quotation: *No matter where suffering happens and who is affected, it has an impact everywhere and on everyone*. 

Once they've done that, students should make sure they know the source of the quotation and whether that source or speaker is reliable. Then they can ask themselves if the quotation belongs in the spot where they're intending to use it. If it does, they can include the source of the quotation and page number on an appropriate detail line of their TO. 

**Determining What's Noteworthy**

It's helpful to explain to students that a longer quote isn't always a better quote. A succinct phrase may have more impact than a discussion that goes on for several lines. 

Nor is it always necessary for students to include a direct quotation. Paraphrasing text often works just as well. However, even if a quotation is paraphrased, students should include an attribution to the text on which it's based. 

Quotations should be reserved for instances when the author of the text has said something particularly noteworthy. Consider guiding your students in identifying those distinctive quotations before they attempt to select them independently. 

**Weaving In Quotations**

Once they've settled on a quotation that is on point and worthy of inclusion, students will need to learn how to weave it into their own writing. 

The book *They Say/I Say*2 suggests introducing quotations using phrases like these:

*Jones states, “* ____________________________________________.” 

*As the author of the article argues, “* _____________________________.” 

*According to Jones, “* _______________________________________.” 

The authors also suggest following up the quotation with an explanation that paraphrases it. For example, 

*In other words, Jones is saying* ________________________________. 

*Therefore, according to the author, * _____________________________. 

*Jones's point is that* ________________________________________. 

**Level 1 Example**

*According to Helen Keller, “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.” *

*Her point was that even though she was blind and deaf, she was still able to experience the most meaningful parts of life*. 

**Level 2 Example**

More advanced students may be quoting from primary sources or historical documents, and this is when setting up and paraphrasing quotations is particularly important. It won't always be clear to a reader where the quotation is from and—especially if the language is complex or archaic—what it means. 

*The Declaration of Independence states, “But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a* *design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for* *their future security.” In other words, revolution is justified only when the government has carried out a sustained and deliberate campaign* *against the rights of the people*. 

**TEACHER TIP**

Emphasize to your students the importance of citations and attribution when they use quotations in their writing. Quotations should be set off by quotation marks or, if lengthy, be indented as a block quote. Older students can be introduced to the various ways to cite sources, such as footnotes, endnotes, and in-text. It's best to demonstrate just one form of documentation, preferably the MLA, 3 APA,4 or

Chicago/Turabian5 formats. 

The example in Exhibit 9.5 assumes students have learned about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

**The MPO for Level 2 Students**

If your Level 2 students have already had practice with the TO, most of the steps involved in creating the MPO will be familiar. 

If they haven't had that practice, guide them through these activities, all of which are described in detail in the previous section:

**OUTLINING**

Select a topic and identify the purpose. 

Develop a thesis statement. 

Fill in the Main Idea boxes. 

Fill in the Details boxes. 

Write a concluding statement. 

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

Use transitions to link paragraphs. 

Incorporate quotations. 

A significant difference between the TO and the MPO is that instead of writing a thesis statement as a stand-alone sentence, students will now create a multi-sentence introductory paragraph composed of a thesis statement as well as general and specific statements. The same is true for a concluding paragraph. This process often requires a good deal of guidance and practice. 

Constructing an MPO involves six steps. The sequence of the steps corresponds to the numbers that appear on the sample MPO template in Exhibit

9.6. MPOs can have three, four, five, or more paragraphs. As we noted earlier, students don't have to start with three-paragraph MPOs and then progress to longer ones. The number of paragraphs assigned should depend on the topic and the content. 

As with the SPO and TO, you should spend a lot of time developing MPOs with the whole class before expecting students to develop an MPO

independently.

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING AN MPO**

1. Select a topic and identify the composition's purpose. 

2. Develop the thesis statement as a complete sentence on the solid line at the top of the outline. Tell students that this is the only time they'll write a complete sentence on the MPO. 

3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the MPO and include T.S. as a reminder to create a topic sentence later when drafting. 

4. Write the supporting details for each main idea in the Details boxes in the right-hand column of the MPO. 

5. Indicate the structure of the introductory paragraph by writing the letters *G* (for *general* statement), *S* (for *specific* statement), and *T* (for *thesis* statement). The statements themselves should be created only after the outline is done. 

6. For the concluding paragraph, invert the order of the introduction to *T*, *S*, and *G*. 

Steps 1–4 have been described previously, but steps 5 and 6 are new and specific to the MPO. The next section will define GST and TSG and describe the process of using them as a guide to develop introductions and conclusions. 

**Using the MPO to Draft and Revise Compositions**

Converting an MPO to a draft is more challenging than undertaking that process with a TO because students will need to create general and specific statements during the drafting process. They will need ample practice with the preparatory activities described in this section. 

Don't forget that students should use transition words and phrases to connect their paragraphs and smoothly incorporate quotations, as discussed previously in this chapter. 

## Introductions: The GST Structure

Introductions set forth the topic of the composition and should engage the reader's interest. Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs requires the ability to summarize information and make generalizations at an even more sophisticated level than that required for writing only the thesis statement. 

Both introductory and concluding paragraphs should consist of at least three sentences. In addition to the thesis statement, students will also need to learn how to construct general and specific statements that support their thesis. This process, which is described in *The St. Martin's Handbook*, 6 will result in coherent paragraphs that provide context for the thesis statement. 

Some teachers may believe that the GST format makes students' introductions too formulaic. But the fact is that most developing writers actually need and appreciate a formula to help them structure coherent introductions and conclusions. We have seen this technique applied in sophisticated essays written by experienced writers. 

According to the handbook, introductory paragraphs should unfold in this order:

1. First sentence: general statement ( *G*)

***There are books that were written decades ago that are relevant today because of their timely themes*****. **

2. Second sentence: specific statement ( *S*)

***The Great Gatsby has fascinated readers over the years because of its focus on extreme wealth, unbridled materialism, ***

***and the decay of social and moral values*****. **

3. Third sentence: thesis statement ( *T*)

***Although the book was published in 1925, the characters, the setting, and the conflicts resonate with present-day readers*****. **

Using the GST format can be challenging. Even students who have had experience crafting thesis statements may need support in coming up with general and specific statements. One way to provide that support is to model or guide them through the process. 

**GST: Classroom Example**

Using the topic of Nelson Mandela, whom the class had been studying, Ms. Jackson began by asking her tenth graders to come up with a **thesis** **statement** about him. After some discussion, the class agreed on the following:

***Nelson Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black***

***president*****. **

After completing the Main Idea and Details boxes for the composition with the whole class, Ms. Jackson asked the students what general category of individuals they thought Mandela belonged to. One student said, “freedom fighters”; another said, “civil rights activists”; and a third suggested

“people who had a big effect on history.” Ms. Jackson chose the third phrasing, and collectively the class wrote:

***During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history*****. **

Ms. Jackson told the class that could be their **general statement**. Now, she said, it was time to narrow the focus to come up with a more **specific** **statement**, perhaps by placing Mandela in a particular place. The students came up with “South Africa.” Ms. Jackson asked them to try writing a specific statement using an appositive. After comparing their different formulations, the class agreed on this one:

***Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa*****. **

The class then put all three sentences together to form an introductory paragraph using the GST format:

***During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history. Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle***

***for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa. Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition***

***of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black president*****. **

Here are two additional examples of introductory paragraphs that follow the GST format. The words in bold indicate elements of the plans of development that are embedded in the thesis statements. 



## BOOK REPORT

**[G]** Only a few of the countless books published each year become classics. **[S]** William Golding's novel about a group of British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash has been required reading in many schools for decades. **[T]** *Lord of the Flies* has intrigued readers because of its **plot, characters, ** and **the lessons** that can be learned from this compelling tale. 

**SIGNIFICANT EVENT**

**[G]** All of the great presidents have a signature achievement that profoundly affected future generations. **[S]** The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France is considered by many to be Thomas Jefferson's outstanding accomplishment. **[T]** As a result of the Louisiana Purchase, he significantly **increased the size of the United States, extended its borders, ** and **opened up new trade routes. **

**Writing General, Specific, and Thesis Statements**

The amount of time you spend teaching your students how to develop general, specific, and thesis statements will vary depending on their abilities and the complexity of the content they're studying. 

The following kinds of activities should be modeled and practiced frequently with the entire class before you have students try them independently. 

The following activities are listed in the sequence in which they should be introduced. 

**1. Write a Thesis Statement (T) When Given a Topic**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a thesis statement (T) for the given topic. 

**TOPIC:** Napoleon's impact

T: ***Napoleon's impact on France had both positive and negative aspects*****. **

**2. Distinguish among General (G), Specific (S), and Thesis (T) Statements**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the general statement, specific statement, and thesis statement by writing G, S, or T. 

*** S *** In 1936, an athlete impressed spectators at the Berlin Olympics with his skill and talent. 

*** T *** Jesse Owens, a formidable Black track and field star, is remembered for shattering world records. 



*** G *** Many Olympians have made a significant impact on their sport. 



**3. Write an S When Given a G and a T**

If students are having trouble coming up with a specific statement, you can suggest that they try answering one or more of the question words ( *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how*). Another good option is to include an appositive. The following example assumes students have read the book *Lyddie*. 7

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a specific statement (S) for the given general statement (G) and thesis statement (T). 

G: People often have different ideas of how to define “fairness.” 

S: ***Diana and Lyddie, two characters in Katherine Paterson's novel Lyddie, have differing points of view*****. **

T: Although Diana is radical and tries to entice other factory workers to sign a petition, Lyddie does not agree with Diana's perspective until the very end of the novel. 

**4. Write a G and an S When Given a T**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a general statement (G) and a specific statement (S) for the given thesis statement (T). 

G: ***An invasive species is an organism that is not native to a particular area*****. **

S: ***In the Florida everglades, the Burmese python has been wreaking havoc on native animal populations since it***

***was first introduced to the area in 1994*****. **

T: Although these enormous reptiles continue to pose a problem for this once-thriving ecosystem, scientists in Florida are developing methods to reduce their numbers. 

**5. Adding Sentences to the Introductory Paragraph**

As students become more proficient, there is no need to limit their introductions to three sentences. Typically, the fourth or fifth sentences are specific statements, often facts or statistics. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write an additional specific statement (S). 

G: As the United States grew in industrial and economic power, two controversial figures emerged. 

S: By the end of the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie controlled almost the entire steel industry and John Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company controlled 90% of the refining business. 

S: ***Both men made tremendous philanthropic contributions that made them heroic in the views of many*****. **

T: However, there have been debates about whether these early builders of big business in America should be considered “robber barons” 

or “captains of industry.” 

**Crafting Conclusions**

As with the concluding statement in the TO, the function of the concluding paragraph in the MPO is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. It should accomplish at least one of the same goals as the TO concluding statement, such as offering a summary, solution, or recommendation. 

The structure of the concluding paragraph reverses the structure of the introductory one: instead of GST, the concluding paragraph follows a TSG

pattern. The thesis statement should be rephrased and positioned as the first sentence instead of the last. 

Consider these examples of an introduction and conclusion following the GST and TSG formats on the topic of the monarch butterfly. 

**INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:**

*The migration of the monarch butterfly has always been fascinating to scientists. However, there are both habitat and environmental factors* *that pose threats to this favorite flying insect. Even though historically the monarch butterfly population has come back from challenges that* *have threatened its existence, recovering from the use of pesticides, climate change, and development may be more problematic*. 

**CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH:**

*Although monarch butterflies have bounced back from past threats caused by nature, the hazards caused by people may be too monumental for* *this popular butterfly population to overcome. Concerns about the future of the monarch are valid and serious. It is imperative to address the* *dangers confronting this remarkable butterfly before it becomes extinct*. 

Remind students that the last words in a composition usually have the most impact on the reader; therefore, the concluding paragraph should contain its key points. After the first sentence, which will be the rephrased thesis statement, students should write specific and general statements that differ from the ones they used in their introductory paragraph. Both should expand on the S and G statements that appear there. If students are having trouble rephrasing the three types of statements in their conclusions, you can provide them with some sample introductory paragraphs and have them practice reconstructing them as concluding paragraphs.

**Title:**

**Two Primary Causes of the American Revolution**

*The factors that led to the American Revolution have been described by countless historians. There were multiple events that played a role* *in the colonists' rebellion, but two are especially important. The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were crucial in the decision to declare* *war on Great Britain*. 

*In 1774, the British wanted to make an example of Massachusetts after the Boston Tea Party. As a result, the Intolerable Acts, a group of* *four acts, were passed. They denied Massachusetts the right to govern itself. In addition, Boston Harbor was blockaded, and fair trials* *were prevented. Finally, the last act applied to all the colonies, not just Massachusetts. British troops were ordered to be stationed at more* *convenient locations and the expenses were to be paid by the colonies*. 

*In 1765, the Stamp Act was intended to raise money from the colonists by taxing all printed paper, even playing cards, but it was enacted* *without the approval of their assemblies. The colonists believed they should have the same rights as the English. Patrick Henry's* *publication attacking the act, Virginia Resolves, was widely read. The phrase “taxation without representation” became popular*. 

*The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were primary reasons for the American Revolution. As a result of the burdens these acts placed on* *the colonists, their fury grew. Their anger eventually led to a strong desire for independence from Great Britain*.

**Differentiating TO and MPO Activities**

Practice in any of the preceding activities can help students who are having difficulty with particular elements of the TO and MPO. Here are some further suggestions you can use for additional support:

TO: Provide students with the thesis and concluding statement(s). 

TO and MPO: Provide students with the thesis statement and words and phrases for the Main Idea column to help them organize their paragraphs. 

TO and MPO: Provide students with both a main idea and details for the first body paragraph. 

MPO: Provide Level 2 students who are ready for the MPO with a thesis statement and/or the general or specific statements to use in their introduction and conclusion. 



**Adapting the TO and MPO: The Pre-Transition Outline**

For students, particularly those in elementary school, who are not ready for the TO or MPO formats, we suggest using a hybrid of an SPO and TO, the Pre-Transition Outline (PTO), to help them begin thinking about the requirements of MPOs and essays. As with the TO, for the PTO students select the topic first and then develop a thesis statement. In contrast to the TO, on the PTO students write out a full topic sentence for each paragraph as they would on an SPO; however, they do not need to add a concluding sentence for each paragraph. Instead, the PTO ends with a concluding statement that paraphrases the thesis statement. 

It's best if the PTO is only two or three paragraphs long and has three or four details. The fourth detail is in parentheses to indicate that it is considered optional depending on the topic. See the following example of a completed PTO. (Also see Appendix J.)

**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)  *Appendix J*

When students have mastered completing the PTO and developing drafts based on it, move right on to the TO. It's preferable to have students become accustomed to the TO sooner rather than later because, together with the MPO, those formats will be more beneficial to students as they write longer essays about more complex and detailed topics.

**Research Papers**

Teaching students effective research skills is challenging but important. If students haven't learned how to research a topic, they may find themselves investing a lot of effort in a project that relies on information that is questionable or just plain wrong. 

It's all too easy for students to stumble on a website that looks reliable but is riddled with misinformation. Students may also mistake personal opinions they find online for fact or become overwhelmed by the amount of information available. 

Make sure your students are staying on track over the days or weeks that they're working on their projects. Once students have their topics, it's best to set up a detailed schedule listing due dates for each stage of the process: gathering material, developing a thesis, coming up with a bibliography, taking and organizing notes, and so on. We suggest that you require students to get your approval for each section before moving on to the next step. 

A full discussion of how to help your students do research online is beyond the scope of this book, but we can offer a few suggestions. We also recommend consulting the article *“* The Challenge That's Bigger than Fake News: Civic Reasoning in a Social Media Environment,” published in *American Educator* magazine and authored by a group of researchers at Stanford University. 8

**Surfing the Internet—with Guardrails**

Model the process of searching online for the class, just as you model TWR strategies and activities. Tell students that when they look for information and evidence on the internet, it's important to be aware of the following guidelines and search suggestions, which are drawn from the aforementioned *American Educator* article as well as an article in *Education Week* on teaching online research skills:9

Use precise keywords in online searches. Typing *Kennedy assassination* might return results about the assassinations of both John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy instead of just one of them. 

Use certain words and symbols to refine online searches. 

Use quotation marks around search terms to get the exact wording. 

Insert “AND” between search terms to produce results that focus on both subjects. 

Include a space followed by a minus sign to eliminate a particular meaning of a term (for example, a student searching for information about the Australian Outback could type *Outback -car* to eliminate results relating to the Outback vehicle). 

Check whether a website's URL ends in *.com*, *.gov*, or *.edu*. Websites connected with a government agency ( *.gov*) or university ( *.edu*) are generally more trustworthy than someone's personal website. But warn students that *.org*, previously associated with mission-driven organizations, is no longer a sign of reliability; practically any organization can now obtain that designation. 

Evaluate websites with a critical eye. Students should be asking questions such as: Who wrote this? What is his or her perspective? Who is sponsoring this site? Are there links and references to other sources that corroborate the information? Asking these questions while on the site itself may not be enough. It can be more useful to leave the site and see what other sources say about it. 

Don't click on the first result that comes up after a Google search. It's best to go down the list and examine URLs and the sentences that accompany each result for clues to reliability. 

Use Wikipedia wisely. Although many educators warn students away from the site, it can be useful if you know how to use it. Students should learn to investigate Wikipedia's “Talk” pages, where they'll find debates on controversial issues, and to use the references at the end of each article as resources for lateral reading. 

Ms. Hamilton was right: her fifth graders didn't do well on their written responses for the state test. But the following year, she tried a different approach. She taught her students sentence-level strategies as well as how to create the SPO and TO. 

In the spring, as in previous years, she wanted to do what she could to prepare her students for the writing prompts they would see on the state test. They would probably still have to deal with unfamiliar content in the reading passages. But, she hoped, at least they would now have writing skills that would help them produce coherent responses. 

The day before testing began, she gave them a text to read about space exploration—a topic they hadn't learned about in class. “Based on this article,” she wrote on the board, “what are the most significant challenges to exploring outer space?” Then she handed out blank sheets of paper. 

Almost all of her students got right to work. But they didn't just start writing. First, they created outlines without a template, identifying the topic and writing a thesis statement below it, using the prompt on the board as a guide. 

Most wrote some version of “There are several significant challenges to exploring outer space,” but some outlined a plan of development. A boy named Malik, for example, wrote, “The most significant challenges to exploring outer space are radiation, the lack of gravity, and the distance from Earth.” 

Then students drew boxes for main ideas and details and began filling them in. Once they had their concluding statements at the bottom, they were off and running, converting their outlines into drafts. 

Ms. Hamilton felt a wave of relief wash over her. This year, when her students saw a writing prompt on the test, she was pretty sure they wouldn't just flail or freeze. They would know what to do. 

**To Sum Up**

Before trying to create TOs, students need ample experience developing topic sentences, writing supporting details in note form, and constructing coherent paragraphs. 

Level 1 and less advanced Level 2 students should initially use these skills to create simple three- or four-paragraph TOs for book reports, biographies, and compositions on scientific or geographic topics. 

Introduce students to the TO or MPO by modeling the process of creating one. 

When students are still learning to create TOs and MPOs, you should assign the topics; for more experienced students, you should provide guidance in selecting a topic. 

Provide students with models of thesis statements that fit the type of TO or MPO they're constructing, and, when appropriate, have them include a plan of development that maps out the structure of the composition. 

Have students fill in the Main Idea and corresponding Details boxes for each paragraph of the TO and MPO in note form. 

To prepare Level 2 students to write introductory paragraphs for the MPO, introduce them to the GST formula—incorporating general, specific, and thesis statements—and have them practice distinguishing among the three types of statements and then creating them. 

Have students reverse the formula to TSG for the conclusion. 

Have students convert their completed TOs and MPOs to drafts and then revise them by varying sentence structure, incorporating quotations (if any), and using transitions to link paragraphs and sentences. 

If Level 2 students' MPOs require independent research, have students commit to a schedule with deadlines for each step of the process.
