## Praise for The Writing Revolution 2.0

“For years, I have recommended *The Writing Revolution* for the following reasons: powerful
sequencing from sentence to composition, skills broken down into obtainable chunks, explicit,
systematic instruction, writing assignments connected to class content, and focus on planning
and revising. Teachers are supported and students emerge as writers. *The Writing Revolution*
truly makes a difference, so schools, teachers, and students should follow this road map to
excellence.”
—Anita Archer, author of *Explicit Instruction: Effective and Efficient Teaching*

“The impact of *The Writing Revolution*, which has expanded our understanding of how
writing builds knowledge and taught us how to embed great writing lessons into daily
instruction across content areas, has been profound. When Judith Hochman, Natalie Wexler,
and Kathleen Maloney think there’s more to say about how we produce strong writers, edu cators need to stop and listen. Drawing on thousands of hours of onsite work with teachers,
*The Writing Revolution 2.0* is a testament to the authors’ belief that good writing instruction
is within the grasp of all teachers and that, indeed, it must be their charge.”
—Barbara Davidson, president of StandardsWork, Inc., and executive director
of the Knowledge Matters Campaign

“We’ve been inspired by the practical approach of the Hochman Method for over three
decades and so have the many teachers we’ve shared it with. We couldn’t be happier about
this second edition since the practices laid out so clearly in this book will make every stu dent exposed to them a more supple and lucid writer.”
—David and Meredith Liben, Reading Done Right, authors of *Know Better,
Do Better: Comprehension*

“This guide needs to be on every educator’s bookshelf! Grounded in *The Writing Revolution’s*
research on writing instruction, this supremely practical book provides teachers, adminis trators, and other practitioners with a robust guide for building students’ writing ability and
knowledge. This book is the best tool a teacher can keep in their toolkit.”
—Esther Klein Friedman, PhD, executive director of Literacy and Academic
Intervention (retired), New York City Department of Education; literacy
learning specialist

“As a principal, it was clear that students in my elementary school needed an organized system
of instruction to improve their writing. My team of teachers fully embraced the Hochman
Method and enjoyed collaboratively learning and planning writing lessons using the multiple
reources provided in *The Writing Revolution*. Every principal and teacher should make it a
priority to utilize the latest edition to advance their knowledge and understanding of how to
effectively teach writing. Your students will develop a love of writing that will last a lifetime.”
—Gwendolyn Payton, instructional superintendent, DCPS

“*The Writing Revolution 2.0* provides teachers with powerful strategies to embed explicit
writing instruction into the content of the curriculum. These strategies equip children with
the tools they need to be confident writers while also developing their comprehension and
critical thinking skills.”
—Lori D’Andrea, literacy specialist, Greenburgh Central School District

“For many Australian teachers, *The Writing Revolution* has, like no other resource, raised
their knowledge and provided educators with the tools they need. I observe the impact of
this instruction on the quality of writing produced by students in settings ranging from
remote communities to large metropolitan areas.”
—Dr. Lorraine Hammond, AM, professional learning and instructional coach,
associate professor at Elizabeth Cowan University, School of Education,
Australia

“The first edition of *The Writing Revolution* was a landmark publication. Not only was it
packed with brilliant classroom techniques, its focus on sentence-level activities changed the
way many people thought about teaching writing. The second edition has even more exam ples taken from the extensive work the authors have done in so many schools and includes
important updates about assessment and comparative judgment. It is a must-read for anyone
involved with teaching writing.”
—Daisy Christodoulou, director of education, No More Marking

“*The Writing Revolution* transformed my thinking about the power of writing and how it can
improve outcomes for students in all content areas. As a former STEM teacher and school
and system leader, I am grateful that the authors have brought the science of writing so
effectively to classrooms.”
—Jean-Claude Brizard, president and CEO, Digital Promise Global

“Teachers, district leaders, superintendents, and stakeholders—anyone who wishes to
witness the transformative power of content-embedded explicit writing instruction—will
benefit exponentially from *The Writing Revolution 2.0*. When it’s fully embraced and taught
campus-wide, even the hardest-to-reach subgroups succeed, prosper, and excel, acquiring
the tools and strategies they need to write well!”
—Serena White, interim superintendent of Monroe City Schools

“Simple and brilliant. Practical and insightful. *The Writing Revolution 2.0* is canon in how to
teach the structures of writing while enabling students to express their individual identities.”
—Anthony Cosentino Jr., principal, Public School 21—The Margaret P. Emery
Elm Park School

## Acknowledgments

First and foremost, we want to acknowledge the co–chief executive officers of
The Writing Revolution, Dr. Dina Zoleo and Dr. Toni-Ann Vroom. Together
with team members Christine Teahan, Alexandria Chalonec, and Tania
Hasselwander-Chang, they read the manuscript multiple times, displayed
endless patience, and made excellent suggestions based on their experience
training teachers in the Hochman Method and working with schools that are
using it. We are forever grateful for their cooperation and talent.

The TWR courses and its Resource Library, created by members of the
TWR team, supplied us with many of the materials we used to illustrate the
strategies and activities in this book.

We also learned a great deal directly from educators who have imple mented the Hochman Method. Reviewing assessments, visiting schools,
listening to teachers and administrators, and looking at countless activities
based on TWR strategies helped inform many of the changes in the second
edition. Teachers throughout the United States and beyond shared their work,
asked questions, and made suggestions that were invaluable in adding to our
knowledge about effective writing instruction.

We owe debts of gratitude to several other individuals. Our editor at Jossey Bass, Amy Fandrei, was supportive, responsive, and patient throughout the pro cess. Maureen Forys helped us immeasurably with the design of the book, and
her guidance and positive attitude inspired us throughout the process. Rachel
Monaghan’s editing and guidance were indispensable. Djamika Smith, TWR’s
associate creative director, was an important contributor to the book-designing
process. Robyn Travers’s experience teaching the Hochman Method for many
years made her an excellent resource for editing expertise and feedback.

Last, but not least, we appreciate the support of our families and friends
and their recognition that our mission is an important one. In particular, two
of us—Judith Hochman and Natalie Wexler—owe a deep debt of thanks to
our husbands, Steve Hochman and Jim Feldman, for their support.

## Foreword

Judith Hochman and Natalie Wexler’s *The Writing Revolution* is a timeless
book that is grounded in practical wisdom, refined by application in
thousands of classrooms, and supported by learning science. It meticulously
describes how to effectively teach a skill that is, and will always be, pro foundly important to students. It’s a book that stands the test of time.

Perhaps fittingly, this foreword, originally published in the first edition
of the book, remains as relevant to me now as it was when I first wrote it.
It is a personal reflection of encountering many of the ideas in *The Writing
Revolution* and testing them with my own children. Every application of the
principles within the book reaffirms their enduring value.

I am not alone in my high regard for this book. Since its publication,
hundreds of thousands of teachers have read and used it with great success. It
has, honestly, become something of a sensation.

However, while the book remains timeless, the world—both in society at
large and within schools—has been rapidly changing. Recognizing this, and
in light of Hochman and Wexler’s dedication to updating the entire text, I will
add a few new thoughts of my own at the end of the original foreword.

A few years ago our family spent a couple of months in London. My kids
were thirteen, eleven, and six at the time, and I had work there, so we decided
to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to live in one of the world’s great
capitals. We paid regular visits to the British Museum, combed through the
food stalls at Borough Market, and traced on foot the remains of the city’s
medieval wall. There were day trips to Bath and Cambridge. We even had a
local—pub, that is, which really should go without saying.

It was an incredible experience, thanks in no small part to what I learned
at a lunch I had with one of the authors of this book before we left. I’d read
an article about Judith Hochman’s work at New Dorp High School in the
*Atlantic* a year or two before, and it had stayed with me. Hochman espoused
embedding writing instruction in content. She thought sentences were over looked and rarely taught. She thought syntax—“syntactic control”—was the
link to unlock the connection between better writing and better reading. She

---
<!-- PAGE 16 -->
<div align="left">xiv The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

believed in the power of deliberate practice to build reading skills. Her work
was technical and granular. And the results were hard to ignore. It was the
kind of thing I was drawn to.

A friend had connected us and I drove down to meet her—with what soon
revealed itself as her typical graciousness, she had invited me to her home
near New York City—and the result was one of the most memorable days of
my working life. I remember scratching notes furiously on page after page of
my notebook, trying to capture everything she observed—about writing, its
connection to reading and thinking, and why so many kids struggled to learn
it. Over and over Hochman would hit on an idea that had been swirling in my
head in inchoate wisps and put it into a clear, logical formulation of practice.
Here was the idea you were fumbling with, described perfectly; here was how
you’d make it work.

I couldn’t write fast enough, but I remember thinking that when I got
home, I would read everything she’d written. This, however, turned out to be
the only disappointment. There wasn’t, until now, any place where the ideas
Hochman had talked about were written down in one cohesive place for a
reader like me. I was left with the observations in my notebook, the hope
that Hochman would someday write the book you are now holding, and her
sentence expansion activities.

It was these activities that were the gift that transformed our trip to
London. Hochman had spent about twenty minutes riffing on the idea the
day we met. The sentence was the building block of writing and thinking, the
“complete thought,” we agreed, but if you looked at the complete thoughts
students produced in their writing, they were too often wooden, repetitive,
inflexible. If the task of wrestling ideas into written words was to memorialize
thinking, students—at least most of them—did not often have control of a
sufficient number of syntactic forms and tools to capture and express complex
thoughts. They could not express two ideas happening at once, with one
predominating over the other. They could not express a thought interrupted
by a sudden alternative thesis. Their ideas were poor on paper because their
sentences could not capture, connect, and, ultimately, develop them. That
last part was the most damning of all. One way to generate complex ideas is
to write them into being—often slowly adding and reworking and refining,
as I find myself doing now as I draft and revise this foreword for the tenth or
twentieth or one hundredth time. Because students could not say what they
meant, and because, as a result, they did not practice capturing and connect ing complex ideas with precision in writing, they had fewer complex ideas. Or

---
<!-- PAGE 17 -->
<div align="right">Foreword xv</div>

they had ideas like the sentences they wrote: predictable, neither compound
nor complex. What might have been a skein of thought was instead a litter of
short broken threads, each with a subject-verb-object construction.

Hochman’s solution was regular intentional exercises to expand students’
syntactic range. You could ask students to practice expanding their sentences
in specific and methodical ways, and they’d get better at it. Crucially, she
pointed out, this must be done in a content-rich environment because “the
content drives the rigor.” Sentences need ideas pressing outward from inside
them to stretch and expand their limits. Only rich content gives them a
reason to seek and achieve nuance.

One example of a Hochman sentence expansion exercise was called *because but-so*. The idea was deceptively simple: you gave students a sentence stem
and then asked them to expand it three different ways—with the common
conjunctions *because*, *but*, and *so*. This would help them to see each sentence
as constantly expandable. And it would, as Hochman writes in this book, “prod
them to think critically and deeply about the content they were studying—far
more so than if you simply asked them to write a sentence in answer to an
open-ended question.” It would build their ability to conjoin ideas with fluid ity. It would help them to understand, through constant theme and variation,
the broader concepts of subordination and coordination.

I want to pause here to digress on the seemingly underwhelming concepts
of coordination and subordination. I will ask you to stifle your yawn as I
acknowledge that they are easy to dismiss—ancient, faintly risible, uttered
once long ago by acolytes of sentence diagramming in the era of chalk dust.
They smack of grammar for grammar’s sake, and almost nobody cares about
that. Teachers instead seek mostly to make sure the sentences work and
dispense with the parsing of parts. It is so much simpler to tell kids to go with
“sounds right” (an idea that inherently discriminates against those for whom
the sounds of language are not happily ingrained by luck or privilege) or to
make the odd episodic correction and not worry about the principle at work.

But coordination and subordination are in fact deeply powerful principles
worth mastering. They describe the ways that ideas are connected, the
nuances that yoke disparate thoughts together. It is the connections as much
as the ideas that make meaning. To master conjunctions is to be able to
express that two ideas are connected but that one is more important than
the other, that one is dependent on the other, that one is contingent on the
other, that the two ideas exist in contrast or conflict. Mastering that skill

---
<!-- PAGE 18 -->
<div align="left">xvi The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

is immensely important not just to writing but to reading. Students who
struggle with complex text can usually understand the words and clauses of a
sentence; it is the piecing together of the interrelationships among them that
most often poses the problem. They understand the first half of the sentence
but miss the cue that questions its veracity in the second half. And so without
mastery of the syntax of relationships, which is what coordination and subor dination are, the sentence devolves—for weak readers—into meaninglessness.

For weeks I reflected on the power of these simple activities for teachers
and students, but my reflections were not limited to my role as an educator.
As a father I was intrigued as well, and I suppose this is the truest test of an
educational idea.

Fast-forward to London some months later, where I found myself for three
months essentially homeschooling the Lemov children, those regular and
long-suffering subjects of a thousand of their father’s teaching ideas. To keep
them writing and thinking I had them keep journals, and in those journals I
found myself using and adapting Hochman’s exercises. They were the perfect
tidy-wrap summation to a long day out exploring.

Here are some early *because-but-so* exercises I rediscovered a few weeks
ago in my then eleven-year-old daughter’s journal.

I gave her the sentence stem: “The Great Fire of London burned 4/5 of
the city . . .”

She wrote:

The Great Fire of London burned 4/5 of the city, because **at the time,
citizens didn’t have the knowledge or equipment to stop the fire
before it spread.**

The Great Fire of London burned 4/5 of the city, but **London survived
and thrived.**

The Great Fire of London burned 4/5 of the city, so **many people had to
live in temporary homes until the city was rebuilt.**

---
<!-- PAGE 19 -->
<div align="right">Foreword xvii</div>

After a visit to the Museum of Natural History, for the sentence stem “The
length of T-Rex’s arms is surprising . . .” she wrote:

The length of T-Rex’s arms is surprising, but **this may have been a
mid-evolutionary stage and had they lived for another million
years their arms might have disappeared altogether.**

A few weeks later I gave her this sentence stem: “Farleigh Hungerford
Castle is now in ruins . . .”

She wrote:

Farleigh Hungerford Castle is now in ruins because **of weathering
and age.**

Farleigh Hungerford Castle is now in ruins, but **it is arguably even
more interesting now (while in ruins) than ever before.**

Farleigh Hungerford Castle is now in ruins, so **you are able to use
some imagination when envisioning the castle at its peak.**

We made these exercises a part of our daily lives, and as we did so their
confidence and the range of syntactical forms my kids used in expanding
their sentences grew, as did the ideas they developed and encoded in
memory.

Another sentence expansion activity Hochman proposed to me in her
living room—and describes at long last in this outstanding book—is delib erate practice using appositives: brief, sometimes parenthetical phrases that,
like the phrase you are reading, rename or elaborate on a noun in a sentence,
and can be surprisingly complex. Mastering this idea enables students to
expand ideas within a sentence, adding detail, specificity, or nuance in a
manner that subordinates the additional information to the overall idea of
the sentence. With appositives mastered, students can link more things into
the dance of interrelationships within a sentence, reducing the redundancy
and disconnectedness of multiple repetitive sentences, and the Lemov kids
reflected on their travels through the music of appositives as well.

<!-- PAGE 20 -->
<div align="left">xviii The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

After a visit to Cambridge and its historic university, I asked them to use
Hochman’s appositive exercise with the sentence: “In Cambridge the ‘backs’
are in fact the ‘fronts.’” You may not understand that sentence at all—it refers
to the fact that when you punt down the River Cam, you face what are called
the backs of the historic colleges, but this name is ironic because the buildings
were mostly built to be seen from the riverside—the backs. My daughter’s
sentence expansion captures this with a smooth elegance that supersedes the
laborious description you just read. She wrote:

In Cambridge, *a small town with a world-renowned university*, the backs,
*the sides of the colleges that face away from the street and therefore onto
the river*, are in fact *the elaborate entrances, the fronts*.

I put the appositives she added in italics. Note here a few things that are
interesting about this sentence from a teaching and learning perspective:

1.  It includes three different appositives, which my daughter used to
    expand her description of Cambridge, turning it from a sentence
    whose meaning was locked in code—what the “backs” and “fronts”
    meant is very specific to Cambridge—and unlocked it for readers
    less familiar with the subject. This form of explication is common to
    papers written in academic discourse and is a key academic skill. But
    even so the three appositives are surprisingly complex.
2.  The second appositive, which explains what the phrase “the backs”
    means, is in fact a compound appositive. First she includes the idea
    that the backs are the sides of Cambridge’s colleges that face away
    from the street. The phrase stands up as an appositive by itself, but
    then she adds—via subordination—a second appositive explaining
    that the backs are also the sides of the buildings that face the river.
    Necessity is the mother of invention. In her effort to explain what she
    knows and enrich the sentence sufficiently, she’s expanded her range,
    experimenting with a doubly complex form of appositive.
3.  The third example is even more interesting. In it, my daughter has
    reversed the common order of appositive formation. Usually the noun
    in a sentence is followed by an appositive phrase that expands on it.
    But here she has instead put the appositive in front of the noun: *the
    sides of the colleges that face away from the street and therefore onto
    the river*, are in fact *the elaborate entrances, the fronts*. She has flipped
    the form and is again experimenting with her growing proficiency. No

<div align="right">Foreword xix</div>

grammar lesson in the world could socialize her to understand and
apply compound appositives and inverted appositives, but there she
was within just a few weeks crafting carefully wrought sentences.

As our time in London went on, I began experimenting with new sentence
expansion activities, and they became a bit of an adventure for my kids—
could they express an idea that mattered and also meet the challenges of
construction I set for them?

Could they, after visiting Kew Gardens, write a sentence about medicinal
plants, starting with *surprisingly* and another sentence using the word *medic inal* and some form of the word *extract* (i.e., extracting, extraction)? Could
they write a one-sentence description of the view from Primrose Hill starting
*standing atop* but not using the name Primrose Hill?

In this sense our time in London was an exploration of the power of sev eral themes that you will find constantly referred to in this book. Hochman
and Wexler’s study of these themes will be immensely useful to you as an
educator, I believe.

The first theme is the idea that if we want students to be great writers we
have to be willing to sometimes teach writing through intentional exercises.
Writing responds to deliberate practice, and this concept is demonstrably
different from mere repetition of an activity, which, as Hochman explains,
is how many schools attempt to teach writing. Let me restate that in the
plainest terms: merely repeating an activity is insufficient to get you better at
it. This is why you are still as poor a driver today as you were when you were
twenty-four. You drive to work every morning without intentional focus on
a specific aspect of your craft. You don’t get feedback. You don’t even know
what the skills of driving are, really. And so you never get better. You get
worse, in fact.

Research—particularly that of psychologist Anders Ericsson—tells us that
for practice to improve skills, it has to have a specific and focused goal and
must gradually link together a series of smaller goals to created linked skills.
It must also be structured in awareness of cognitive load theory—it has to be
difficult, to pose a real challenge but not be so difficult that learners engage in
random, nonproductive guessing to solve problems and not so difficult that
the brain shuts down. As cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham points out,
the brain learns best when it is challenged in a manageable amount. Finally,
deliberate practice requires all-in focus, and that is maximized in a short and

<!-- PAGE 22 -->
<div align="left">xx The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

intense burst. This book’s proposal of sequences of adaptable high-quality
exercises that can allow for deliberate practice should be adopted immediately
by nearly every school.

Second is the idea that writing, thinking, and reading are indelibly linked.
They are the three tasks of idea formation and so there is far-reaching power
for all of these domains in focusing on the craft of formation. “I write,” Joan
Didion famously observed, “to know what I think.” Related, then, is the idea
that revision is not especially separable from writing. This much I know as a
professional writer: as soon as this sentence emerges on your laptop screen
you are planning its revision, and helping students to master this hidden
phase of writing is necessary to ensuring that students develop refined ideas,
not just hasty first-blush ones. This book’s study of revision’s wherefores and
whys will be invaluable to schools.

Third is the idea that there is a scope and sequence to all this. The numi nous task of writing can in fact be taught step-by-step with a bit of intention ality if you have Hochman’s wisdom and knowledge to guide you. Now you
don’t have to invent it. The tasks and activities are outlined and organized for
you here. You can move directly to execution.

Fourth is the idea of *embedded in content*. Writing is a learning activity as
much or more than a discrete subject. It operates in synergy with ideas—the
need to express them is, after all, the reason for being for what is otherwise
an unnatural and artificial activity. This book will help you to make every
classroom in your school “writing intensive” and therefore learning intensive.
If I could wave a magic wand over America’s schools and cause one change
that would drive the most demonstrable improvement to learning and
achievement, I would almost certainly wave that wand and conjure up small
bursts of intense, reflective, high-quality writing in every class period or every
hour across America’s schools.

Perhaps last is my own lesson from London: that writing, when taught
well, is a joy. You build something real and enduring every time, and this is
a source of pleasure, as is the unexpected form it takes. Successful writing
gives its practitioner the mystery and satisfaction of constant invention and
construction. When you look at the page and wonder, “Now where did that
idea come from?” you know you are doing it right; you know your mastery
of the craft itself is now guiding you. In that sense this is a magical book, one
that can help you achieve a sea change in the minds of the students in your
classrooms.

<div align="right">Foreword xxi</div>

I previously mentioned the changing world in which the timeless skill of
writing must be taught. One of the most significant changes since the book’s
first edition relates to technology, particularly the universal adaptation of the
smartphone and the looming presence of AI. It’s worth considering how these
developments impact the relevance of the ideas in *The Writing Revolution*.
Spoiler alert: they only underscore their importance.

Smartphones have led to the fracturing of students’ attention. Smartphones
have fractured everyone’s attention, but given that students’ brains are still
developing, they are especially prone to this. This phenomenon affects in
all subjects and content areas but doubly so with writing. As Hochman and
Wexler note, writing places significant demands on executive functions and
working memory. The costs of giving in to distractions, failing to sustain
effort, and veering off topic are especially high. Writing and rewriting require
constant self-monitoring persistence and sustained focus over time.

Effective instruction, such as that provided by *The Writing Revolution*,
which builds and reinforces these essential skills, becomes even more crucial
in combating the distractions posed by smartphones. The book’s model can
be deliberately adapted to cultivate stamina and persistence, providing a
structured approach to developing attention skills.

Moreover, in a world where distractions abound and moments of intro spection are increasingly scarce thanks to push notifications, the TWR model
can be adapted to deliberately focus on building stamina and persistence. The
flexible exercises, tools, and framework offered in *The Writing Revolution* can
be used to structure longer writing sessions and socialize students to help
increase their attention skills. Writing gives students a way to slow down
their brains and access deliberate thinking, a skill that we cannot afford to
let slip away.

Sustained writing is especially valuable when it ends in a final product
students feel proud of. The model of careful, deliberate planning of a longer
piece is immensely valuable if we want students to see the value of per sistence. The planning process in *The Writing Revolution* makes the next step
clear and actionable, keeps focus top of mind, and allows students to build
executive function skills. Put a star next to that chapter, as I know you will
want to revisit it often.

I also recommend you frequently reread the chapter on revision tasks. One
of the biggest benefits of shorter, sentence-length writing exercises is the ease

---
<!-- PAGE 24 -->
<div align="left">xxii The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

with which they can allow for immediate study and revision. The shorter the
writing, the more quickly and easily we can model that this is how we take
an idea and reflect on it, refine it, and develop it. This allows us to implicitly
tell students that their first response may not be complete, which is a useful
message in a “hot take” world. Techniques like Show Call can be invaluable
in facilitating immediate study and revision, fostering a culture of continuous
improvement in student writing.

AI presents another set of challenges for educators, particularly regarding
the integrity of work done outside the classroom. This may lead to resurgence
in in-class, on-demand writing assessments across various subjects. Bell bot toms and vinyl records made their triumphant return to cultural relevance,
and this is your sign to not sleep on the blue book!

This likely rise of in-class, on-demand writing across all subjects as a
necessary tool for assessing students’ own thinking and knowledge will only
put a greater value on writing, and the fact that much of this writing will
necessarily be time-bound and done under a bit of pressure will instill the
good habits of planning and execution. The executive function skills required
to define, pursue, and stay focused on a topic will also be some of the most
essential in the next era of schooling.

While writing is a timeless skill, it has never been more relevant or import ant than today, and so, too, is the ability to teach it well. Enjoy the book. Read
it deeply, experiment with it, and take pleasure in how it helps you help your
students.

## Letter to Readers:
## What’s Different about
## *The Writing Revolution 2.0*

In the years since the first edition of *The Writing Revolution* came out in 2017,
much has changed. But teachers’ need for a clear guide to explicit, carefully
sequenced writing instruction is as great as ever—if not greater.

We’ve seen the emergence of artificial intelligence programs that can spit
out an essay in less than a minute—one that is better written than what many
high school and even college students can produce, and is hard to detect as
a computer’s creation. This development has led some educators to conclude
that it’s no longer possible to assign writing since there’s no way of ensuring
students will turn in their own work. Others have urged that artificial intel ligence be used the way a calculator is for basic operations in a math class:
given a bot-created piece of writing, students can edit and refine it, devoting
their energies to higher-order elements of writing like voice.

Unfortunately, there’s no shortcut to enabling students to become
better writers. For one thing, many students lack the basic writing skills that
would enable them to be good editors. More fundamentally, the writing
process is a learning process. If students are merely trying to revise a piece
of writing they haven’t produced, they’re likely to retain less information
and have a shallower understanding of the material. They may even struggle
to understand the text they’re revising if they’re not familiar with complex
sentence structure. Explicit writing instruction of the kind described in this
book, woven into everyday classroom teaching, is the most effective way to
ensure that students acquire the skills and knowledge they’ll need to succeed
academically and beyond—even if some will inevitably choose to rely on
artificial intelligence for help in drafting a piece of writing at some point.

Against the background of these developments—and drawing on the
expertise of The Writing Revolution organization’s faculty, who have trained
thousands of teachers in the method and work with partner schools that are
implementing it—we have made a number of changes in this new edition.
Although the first edition has reached far more teachers than we ever

---
<!-- PAGE 26 -->
<div align="left">xxiv The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

anticipated and has been met with a gratifyingly positive response, we felt
there were aspects of the book that could be improved.

If you’re familiar with the original version, the changes you’ll see in this
version include:

*   **The addition of two new outlines, the Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)
    and the Transition Outline (TO), as possible steps between the
    Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO) and the Multiple-Paragraph
    Outline (MPO).** It’s become clear to us that many students who
    have learned to outline and write paragraphs are ready to embark on
    lengthier writing but not yet equipped for the demands of the MPO,
    which requires students to compose challenging introductory and
    concluding paragraphs when converting their outlines into drafts. The
    TO requires only a thesis statement at the beginning and a concluding
    statement at the end, along with notes for body paragraphs in between.
    Students who are not ready for the TO or MPO formats can use the
    PTO to help them begin thinking about the requirements of MPOs
    and essays.
*   **Changes in the sequence of sentence activities.** Sentence expansion
    is introduced earlier than in the previous edition. When young
    students learn to expand a bare-bones sentence into one that is more
    complex, it helps them learn to provide the kind of information
    readers need for comprehension.
*   **The introduction of transitions as sentence activities.** Previously,
    transition words weren’t introduced until the chapter on revision.
    Using transition words is an important element of revision, but
    students benefit from using sentence activities to learn and practice
    the strategy.
*   **More illustrations of all strategies.** We hope these examples will help
    readers adapt the strategies to whatever content they’re teaching.
*   **Questions for book discussion groups.** We’ve become aware that
    many educators are reading and discussing the book collaboratively,
    and we hope these questions will serve as a guide. Those who read the
    book on their own may also benefit from them.

---
<!-- PAGE 27 -->
<div align="right">Letter to Readers: What’s Different about *The Writing Revolution 2.0* xxv</div>

*   **More online resources.** Readers will be able to access updated
    customizable templates as well as examples of activities embedded in
    frequently used content. They’ll also have access to posters, sample
    pacing guides, and assessment resources, along with videos showing
    classroom teachers using the strategies.
*   **An expanded discussion of assessment.** We’ve added material on
    formative and summative assessments, and on how to administer
    writing prompts at the beginning, middle, and end of the year and
    evaluate students’ responses.

Whether this book is your introduction to The Writing Revolution’s
method or you’ve been applying the method from your well-thumbed copy of
the first edition for years, we hope you’ll find these changes helpful—and that
you’ll soon be seeing your students grow in confidence and ability.

Throughout the book we’ve included student writing samples. Some of these
samples are from actual students (under pseudonyms or first names only),
and others were created by The Writing Revolution staff members. Some edu cator and student names have been changed, and in other cases, and where
noted, we’ve used real names with the individual’s blessing. Some anecdotes
and classroom examples, although based on actual experience, incorporate
invented characters and events.

## What Teachers Need:
## A Road Map for Explicit
## Writing Instruction

Ms. Cappiello’s class is not unusual. Across the country, countless students
have problems expressing themselves clearly and coherently in writing. On
nationwide tests, only about 25 percent of students are able to score at a
proficient level in writing.¹

And yet, **expository writing**—the kind of writing that explains and
informs—is essential for success in school and the workplace. Students who
can’t write at a competent level struggle in secondary school and in college.
No matter what path students choose in life, the ability to communicate their
thoughts in writing in a way that others can easily understand is crucial.

The problem is not that students are incapable of learning to write well.
Rather, the problem is that many schools haven’t been teaching students how
to write. Teachers may assign writing, but they may not know how to explicitly
teach it in a careful sequence of logical steps, beginning at the sentence level.

Just as with Ms. Cappiello, most teachers’ training didn’t include instruc tion in how to teach writing. The assumption has been that if students read
and write enough, they’ll simply pick up writing skills, through a kind of
osmosis. Sometimes this is called the “writing is caught” approach. But there’s
little evidence to support it. A recent two-year study done with young chil dren in Norway, for example, found that just having students write *more* had
no effect on the quality of their writing.²

---
<!-- PAGE 33 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 3</div>

There’s ample evidence that very few students become good writers on their
own. Many students—even at the college level—have difficulty constructing
a coherent sentence, let alone a fluid, cohesive essay. Perhaps at least some of
your students, maybe most, fall into that category.

To be effective, writing instruction should start in elementary school.
However, when students do get a chance to write in elementary school,
they’re often encouraged to write at length too soon. They don’t learn how
to construct interesting and grammatically correct sentences first, and they
aren’t encouraged to plan or outline before they write longer pieces. The
idea is that later on they’ll refine their writing, under the teacher’s guidance,
bringing coherence and—perhaps—correct grammar and punctuation to
what they’ve produced. But after getting feedback, students may be reluctant
to rewrite a multi-page essay that they’ve already worked on for hours. And
teachers, confronted by pages of incoherent, error-riddled writing, may not
know where to begin.

When students get to middle school or high school, it’s assumed that
they’ve already learned the basics of writing. As secondary teachers like
Ms. Cappiello know, that assumption has little to do with reality. But rather
than beginning with teaching the fundamental skills their students lack—by,
for example, guiding students through the process of writing well-crafted
sentences—teachers feel pressured to have their students meet grade-level
expectations and produce multi-paragraph essays.

High school teachers have long been expected to ask students to write
analytically about the content of the courses they’re taking. But in years past,
many students had written nothing except narratives in elementary and
middle school, often about their personal experiences. That kind of writing
didn’t prepare them for the demands of high school, college, or the workforce.

Many states have revamped their standards. As a result, teachers at almost
all grade levels are now expected to have students write not just narratives,
but also informative and argumentative essays. The result is that websites
abound with worksheets designed to teach these skills—for example, an
“opinion essay” worksheet asking first graders to write about which they like
better, M&M’s® or Skittles®.

It’s unlikely those kinds of activities will prepare students to write the
analytical and argumentative essays they’ll be expected to produce at higher
grade levels, but there’s been little reliable guidance on what to do instead.³

<!-- PAGE 34 -->
<div align="left">4 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

The writing standards tell teachers where their students should end up, but
what teachers need is a road map that tells them how to get there.

The Writing Revolution (TWR), a nonprofit organization, offers such a
road map by disseminating the Hochman Method to educators around the
world. The Hochman Method provides a clear, coherent, evidence-based
method of instruction that you can use no matter what subject or grade level
you teach. The method has demonstrated, over and over, that it can turn weak
writers into strong ones by focusing students’ writing practice on specific
techniques that match their needs and providing them with prompt and clear
feedback. Insurmountable as the writing challenges faced by many students
may seem, TWR’s method can make a dramatic difference. (We will be using
the terms “Hochman Method” and “TWR” interchangeably.)

## What Writing Instruction
## Can Do for You and
## Your Students

Explicit writing instruction will help you and your students in the
following ways:

*   **Identifying comprehension gaps.** When you ask your students to
    write about what they’re learning, you may uncover significant gaps in
    their knowledge that are preventing them from accessing grade-level
    material.
*   **Familiarizing students with complex syntax.** The vocabulary and
    syntax, or sentence structure, of written language is more complex
    than that of spoken language, and students who are unfamiliar with
    it often struggle with comprehension. The problem is widespread:
    One large-scale, long-term study found that fewer than 10 percent
    of U.S. eighth graders can “evaluate complex syntax.”⁴ And, as
    reading expert Timothy Shanahan has observed, “There is now a
    slew of rigorous studies revealing that an understanding of syntax
    is correlated with reading comprehension.”⁵ When students learn to
    use more sophisticated syntax and vocabulary in their own writing,
    they become better able to understand it when they encounter it in
    their reading.⁶

---
<!-- PAGE 35 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 5</div>

*   **Boosting reading comprehension and learning.** Studies have found
    that when students at any grade level write about texts they have read
    and content they have been taught—not just in English, but also in
    social studies, science, and math—their reading comprehension and
    learning is enhanced.⁷ Writing across the disciplines “can improve
    reading comprehension, critical thinking, and disciplinary content
    knowledge,” according to a panel of experts convened by the U.S.
    Department of Education.⁸ For example, one study done with students
    who were English-language learners and had also been diagnosed with
    math disabilities found that when they were taught to rewrite word
    problems, they made significant, lasting gains in math ability.⁹
*   **Enhancing speaking abilities.** As students begin to use more
    complex terms and sentence constructions in their written language,
    many of them begin to incorporate those features into their spoken
    language as well.
*   **Improving organizational and study skills.** TWR activities teach
    students to paraphrase, take notes, summarize, and make **outlines**.
    These techniques help them absorb and retain crucial information.
    In particular, studies of summarizing have found strong effects for
    struggling readers. After reviewing the research, the National Reading
    Panel concluded that summarizing helps students integrate ideas,
    generalize, and retain information.¹⁰
*   **Developing analytical capabilities.** The process of writing
    requires even young students to organize their ideas and sequence
    information. As they move through the grades, they have to sift
    through more material, deciding for themselves what’s important,
    which facts and ideas are connected to one another, and how to
    organize their thoughts into a logical progression. **When done in
    a systematic and sequenced way, teaching students to write is
    equivalent to teaching them how to think.**

Students who have the opportunity to learn TWR strategies and practice
them through carefully scaffolded activities become better at understanding
what they read, expressing themselves orally, and thinking critically.

## A Brief History of
## The Writing Revolution

Years ago, like most classroom teachers, I would assign writing activities that
focused on my students’ experiences, creativity, and feelings: a visit to an
imaginary country, a meaningful moment in their lives. My undergraduate and
graduate training hadn’t included any preparation for teaching writing, nor had
I been asked to read any research on effective writing instruction. (*I* refers to
Judith Hochman.)

Later, as an administrator, I observed many similar lessons. In the higher
grades, when teachers assigned compositions, they assumed that students
would intuitively know how to sequence and organize information, relate it to
a reader with clarity and coherence, and develop sound introductions and con clusions. The results consistently and dramatically disproved these assumptions.

I was struck by the difference in how our school taught writing as opposed
to reading. When I taught reading, I didn’t just give my students a book and
say, “Read this.” I used a well-researched approach to teaching reading based
on the Orton-Gillingham method.¹¹ It provided explicit phonics instruction
in decoding and used carefully sequenced activities that scaffolded skills until
students read fluently and accurately. But when it came to writing, arguably
a far more difficult task, I had no way to give students the tools they needed.
If their writing fell short, as it often did, we simply told them things like “you
can do better” or “add more details.” Clearly, that wasn’t enough.

Then as now, academic researchers were paying far more attention to
reading than writing. As a result, I began to experiment. First as a director of
curriculum, and later as head of the school, I asked teachers to stop teaching
the mechanics of writing in isolation. Instead, we asked students to write
about the content they were learning. Our feedback might be “put your
strongest argument last,” “use transitions when presenting your points,” or
“try starting your thesis statement with a subordinating conjunction.” Since
we had explicitly taught them how to use these strategies, they were able to
respond correctly.

As I saw that these techniques were working for our students, I noticed
that researchers who were looking into best practices for teaching writing

---
<!-- PAGE 37 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 7</div>

were finding evidence that supported what we were doing. The techniques we
were using weren’t just turning our students into better writers. We also saw
improvements in their analytical thinking, reading comprehension, and oral
communication.

In 2012, an article appeared in the magazine *The Atlantic*¹² about how this
method produced dramatic results at a low-performing high school in New
York City. As the article describes, before the school adopted the Hochman
Method, many students didn’t know how to construct sentences using conjunc tions such as *but* and *so*—not to mention words such as *although* and *despite*.
After the school had implemented these new writing strategies for a couple of
years, various measures of achievement there rose sharply.

The article spurred a tremendous amount of interest in the method, and in
response, I founded a nonprofit that used the title of the *Atlantic* article: The
Writing Revolution.

Educators from around the country—in fact, from around the world—
have been learning the method and how to implement it through courses
provided by TWR. We’ve found that teachers are eager for guidance in how
to explicitly teach writing—something that still isn’t covered in most teach er-prep programs.¹³ Many educators who take TWR’s courses find that their
students benefit from explicit, scaffolded writing instruction. The Hochman
Method—and the principles that underlie it—can benefit any student in any
grade at any school.

## Why Many Students Don’t
## Get the Benefits of Writing

Earlier, we listed many potential benefits of writing, noting that it can
boost reading comprehension, oral expression, and learning in general.
Unfortunately, though, many if not most students aren’t getting those
benefits.

A basic reason is that writing is extremely difficult. In fact, it may be the
hardest thing we ask students to do. That’s because it imposes a heavy burden

---
<!-- PAGE 38 -->
<div align="left">8 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

on **working memory**, the aspect of our consciousness that takes in and tries
to make sense of new information.

Working memory can hold only a few new items of information—
maybe just four or five—for about 20 seconds before it starts to become over whelmed. Inexperienced writers are trying to juggle many different things
in working memory at the same time—everything from letter formation, if
they’re young, to word choice, to organizing their thoughts. As a result, they
may not have the capacity in working memory to learn how to write well or
to analyze the content they’re writing about. That’s especially true if the con tent is relatively unfamiliar—and if inexperienced writers are asked to write
at length. They miss out on the opportunity to learn to write well and on all
those other benefits that writing can offer.

Different individuals have different working memory capacities, but there’s
no reliable way to expand any individual’s working memory. There is, how ever, a reliable way around its constraints: if you have relevant information
stored in **long-term memory**, you don’t need to juggle it in working memory.
That opens up more capacity in working memory to take in new information.

Long-term memory can store an unlimited amount of information for
an indefinite period of time. When it comes to writing, that information
includes not only knowledge of the content you’re writing about, but also
knowledge of various writing strategies: how to vary your sentence structure,
how to connect your thoughts, or how to organize a paragraph or essay.
Once students have acquired knowledge of those strategies, that knowledge
will be stored in long-term memory, ready to be drawn on when needed.

Before you can tap into the power of long-term memory, though, two
things need to happen. First, you need to transfer the new information from
working memory to long-term memory, generally by attaching meaning to it.
A powerful way of doing that is to explain the information to another person
in our own words—as we do when we write.

Second, you need to be able to **retrieve** the information from long-term
memory when you need it. The more you practice retrieving it, the more
accessible the information will be. Studies have shown that **retrieval practice**
is a great way to commit new learning to memory for students of all ages,
from elementary school through college. And one highly effective form of
retrieval practice is writing.¹⁴

---
<!-- PAGE 39 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 9</div>

The fact that writing is both a form of transfer and retrieval practice helps
explain why it can provide such a powerful boost to learning. But it can only
provide that boost if a learner’s working memory isn’t overwhelmed by the
act or writing itself.

Writing is double-edged. It can impose a crippling burden on working
memory—and it can provide a way around its limitations. The key to
unlocking its potential is to break down the writing process into manageable
components—and guide students to practice each one.

## Deliberate Practice Makes
## The Writing Revolution
## Revolutionary

Unlike most other approaches to writing instruction, TWR is as much a
method of teaching content as it is a method of teaching writing. There’s no
separate writing block and no separate writing curriculum. Instead, teachers
of all subjects can and should adapt TWR’s strategies and activities to their
preexisting curriculum and weave them into their content instruction.

But perhaps what’s most revolutionary about TWR’s method is that it takes
the mystery out of learning to write well. In other approaches, a teacher might
give students a description of the elements of a good paragraph or essay, or
perhaps present a model piece of writing and have them try to emulate it. For
many students, that’s not enough. They may be able to read and appreciate
writing that flows well and uses varied sentence structures, but that doesn’t
mean they can figure out how to write that way themselves. For them, the
techniques of good writing are a secret code they just can’t crack.

TWR’s method lets them in on the secret. It breaks the writing process
down into manageable chunks and then has students practice the chunks they
need, repeatedly, while also learning content. For example, many students
don’t fully understand what makes a sentence a sentence. Giving them a
definition—a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate and
expresses a complete thought—is not enough. What they need is lots of prac tice distinguishing between groups of words that form complete sentences

---
<!-- PAGE 40 -->
<div align="left">10 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

and groups of words that are sentence fragments. If you embed this activity in
content students have recently learned and ask them to add the information
needed to turn the fragments into sentences, they will not only be learning
the basic skill of forming a complete sentence but also reinforcing their
knowledge of that content.

This kind of practice—**deliberate practice**, as some cognitive scientists
call it¹⁵—is different from having students practice writing by giving them a
half an hour to write and simply turning them loose. Merely doing the same
thing over and over is unlikely to improve their performance. To make their
writing better, they need a series of exercises that specifically target the skills
they haven’t yet mastered, while building on the skills they already have, in a
gradual, step-by-step process. In addition, they need clear, direct feedback to
help them identify their mistakes and monitor their progress.

Although you will be the ultimate judge of exactly what your students
need and when they need it, TWR provides activities that will enable them to
engage in deliberate writing practice—along with vocabulary that you can use
to give them prompt, effective feedback.

## The Six TWR Principles

TWR’s method rests on six basic principles:

1.  Students need explicit instruction in writing, preferably beginning in
    the early elementary grades.
2.  Sentences are the building blocks of all writing.
3.  When embedded in the content of the curriculum, writing instruction
    is a powerful teaching tool.
4.  The content of the curriculum drives the rigor of the writing activities.
5.  Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.
6.  The two most important phases of the writing process are planning
    and revising.

### Principle 1: Students Need Explicit
### Instruction in Writing, Preferably
### Beginning in the Early Elementary Grades

Most students won’t pick up writing skills just by reading. Many students who
are good readers struggle when it comes to writing. Unlike reading, writing
involves deciding what to say, which words to use, how to spell them, perhaps
how to form the letters, and what order to place the words in—and that’s just
at the sentence level. Writing a paragraph or an entire essay requires even
more decision-making, planning, and analysis.

Just as good readers aren’t necessarily good writers, students who can
speak coherently often write incoherently. Far too many students write the
way they speak, using simple sentences, rambling ones, or fragments. That
kind of communication may work when we’re speaking to someone in front
of us: the listeners’ facial expressions and gestures indicate whether they’re
following what we’re saying, and we may already be aware of how much they
know about the subject we’re discussing.

However, when we write, we don’t have visual cues to draw on, and we
often don’t know exactly who the audience is. We need to express ourselves
with far more precision and clarity, anticipating the facts and details a reader
will require to grasp our meaning. We also need to rely on words and punc tuation rather than intonation and pauses to indicate nuances in meaning
or breaks in the narrative. We have to abide by conventions of spelling and
grammar to ensure that mistakes don’t distract a reader from the content.

Although good writing should be clear and direct, it almost always
involves more complex sentence structures and a more varied and precise
vocabulary than spoken language. When we speak, we rarely begin sentences
with words such as *despite* or *although*, but they can be extremely useful in
written language. And connecting our thoughts with phrases like *as a result*
or *specifically*, although unnecessary in most conversational speech, can be
vital in creating a fluid piece of writing.

More generally, when we write, our words are preserved on paper or on
a screen, making not just grammatical and syntactical errors but also logical
flaws far more glaring than in spoken language. And we rarely sustain spoken
language for the equivalent length of a paragraph, let alone an essay, unless
we’re delivering a speech or participating in a formal debate. Shaping a logical,

---
<!-- PAGE 42 -->
<div align="left">12 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

unbroken narrative or argument in writing requires far more thought and plan ning than having a conversation or making a contribution to class discussion.

The elementary grades are the ideal time to begin writing instruction. If
we assign only stories, journal entries, and poems in the early grades—as I
did as a young teacher—we’re wasting precious time. Although it’s certainly
possible to introduce expository writing skills at higher grade levels, it’s
much easier to begin the process in elementary school. Even children in
the earliest elementary grades can engage in TWR activities orally, under a
teacher’s guidance, laying the groundwork for actual writing. Later, elemen tary students can practice their spelling and vocabulary words by completing
thoughtfully focused writing activities related to the content they’re learning
about. At the same time, they can hone their handwriting skills.

We need to equip children with the tools that will give them confidence
as writers and enable them to express themselves in a way that others can
understand. And far from feeling that practicing the mechanics of writing is
drudgery, students often gain a sense of pride and mastery from learning to
craft well-constructed sentences and logically sequenced paragraphs.

### Principle 2: Sentences Are the Building
### Blocks of All Writing

In many schools, the quantity of writing has long been valued over its
quality. Teachers often feel pressure to assign essay-length writing well before
students are capable of producing coherent text. If students haven’t learned
how to write an effective sentence, that is where instruction needs to begin—
no matter what the student’s age or grade level.

Of course, students must learn to write at length, and TWR includes
strategies and activities designed to guide them through that process. But
a writer who can’t compose a decent sentence will never produce a decent
essay—or even a decent paragraph. And if students are still struggling to
write sentences, they have less brain power available to do the careful plan ning that writing a good paragraph or composition requires. A sentence-level
assignment is manageable for students who are still grappling with grammar,
syntax, spelling, and punctuation.

Sentence-level writing shouldn’t be dismissed as something that’s too basic
for older students to engage in. As Bruce Saddler has observed, sentences

---
<!-- PAGE 43 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 13</div>

“are literally miniature compositions.”¹⁶ Producing even a single sentence can
impose major cognitive demands on students, especially if it requires them
to explain, paraphrase, or summarize sophisticated content. Many kinds
of sentence-level activities, including most described in this book, develop
knowledge and analytical abilities while simultaneously enabling students to
learn the mechanics of sentence construction.

Even at the sentence level, students need appropriate guidance if their
writing skills are to improve. TWR gives teachers an array of activities that
guide students to use complete sentences, vary their structure, and employ
complex syntax and new vocabulary—while at the same time ensuring that
they master content.

As students begin to acquire basic sentence-level skills, TWR also provides
structured support for lengthier writing. But crafting an effective sentence is
a useful and important exercise, no matter the skill level of the student, and
teachers should continue to assign sentence-level activities even after students
have moved on to writing paragraphs and compositions. **TWR’s method
is meant to be recursive, with students returning to activities that have
previously been introduced—and not necessarily waiting for “mastery” of
one kind of strategy before moving on to another.**

That means that you don’t need to wait until your students have mastered
all the TWR sentence-level strategies before allowing them to move on to
lengthier writing. They can begin to develop simple outlines and compose
single paragraphs, depending on their ability level. Ideally, however, you won’t
ask them to write independently at length until after they have learned some
basic skills. Those include distinguishing sentences from fragments; using
simple conjunctions like *because*, *but*, and *so*; and using simple subordinating
conjunctions like *before* and *when*. Students should also have learned how to
outline a paragraph or an essay before being asked to write one independently.

### Principle 3: When Embedded in the
### Content of the Curriculum, Writing
### Instruction Is a Powerful Teaching Tool

When schools do focus on expository writing, the assignments are often on
topics that draw only on students’ personal experiences or opinions rather
than on the content of what they are actually studying in English, history,

---
<!-- PAGE 44 -->
<div align="left">14 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

science, math, or other subjects. Students may, for example, practice persua sive writing by taking pro or con positions on school uniforms or they may
learn to write a compare-and-contrast essay by weighing the benefits and
disadvantages of being famous.

Such general topics can be useful for introducing students to a particular
aspect of writing—say, creating topic sentences or learning how to develop
outlines. But until students have had quite a bit of systematic and targeted
instruction, the writing skills they develop when writing about one subject
are unlikely to transfer to another. Even if students learn to write a decent
persuasive essay on why they should have a bigger allowance, they probably
won’t be able to apply those skills to an essay arguing that the Civil War was
fundamentally about slavery.

Another frequent practice is to have students write about topics in a sep arate writing curriculum. Often that curriculum provides students with very
little information on the topic they’re supposed to write about. There are two
fundamental problems with that approach.

One is that having students write about topics unrelated to the core
curriculum—whether they’re grounded in personal experience or opinion or
in a separate writing curriculum—represents a huge wasted opportunity to
boost their learning. Writing isn’t merely a skill; it’s also a powerful teaching
tool. When students write, they—and their teachers—figure out what they
don’t understand and what further information they need. And, as we have
observed in many classrooms, when students write about the content they’re
studying, they learn to synthesize information and produce their own inter pretations. If students are learning about Ancient Egypt or about tornadoes
and hurricanes, part of the instruction in those subjects should include
having students write about them.

The other problem is that writing and content knowledge are intimately
related. **You can’t write well about something you don’t know well.** The more
students know about a topic before they begin to write, the better they’ll be
able to write about it. At the same time, the process of writing will deepen their
understanding of a topic and help cement that understanding in their memory.

An even more fundamental problem in many elementary schools, and
sometimes middle schools, is that the curriculum doesn’t go deeply into *any*
content. The school day is devoted almost entirely to reading and math, and
the reading block often consists mostly of practice in reading comprehension

---
<!-- PAGE 45 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 15</div>

skills, using texts on a random variety of topics. Not only is this an ineffective
way to boost reading comprehension,¹⁷ it can make it difficult if not impossible
to teach writing. If students are jumping from one topic to another, because the
focus is on comprehension skills rather than content, they may not have enough
information about any one topic to write coherently about it. If your school isn’t
covering topics in any depth, don’t despair: you can still use TWR’s method to
develop your students’ abilities to write and to learn in general. But you’ll proba bly need to bring in additional materials to enrich the content of the curriculum.

For students to become proficient readers and writers, all subjects, includ ing English language arts, must include substantial content. And all teachers,
no matter their subject area, must be writing teachers. Teachers of history,
science, world languages, math, and even music, art, and physical education
have learned to incorporate TWR activities into their instruction. Although
schools may exercise some flexibility in deciding which classes will adopt
TWR, keep in mind that the more teachers who use a common language for
writing instruction within a given school, the better the results.

Teachers of subjects other than English may be apprehensive about incor porating the teaching of writing into their curricula. They may feel that they
never signed up to be writing teachers. However, in our experience most of
them find that rather than detracting from their instruction, implementing
TWR actually enhances their ability to teach and boosts their students’ grasp
of the content they’re studying. And although the strategies should be prac ticed daily, they may take only 5 to 15 minutes of class time. They can be used
as quick comprehension checks, **do-now activities**, and **exit tickets**.

### Principle 4: The Content of the
### Curriculum Drives the Rigor of the
### Writing Activities

If you follow Principle 3 and connect your students’ writing activities with the
subject matter that you’re teaching, you’ll find that you can use the same activ ities for any grade level or content area and still challenge your students. The
format of the activity will stay the same, but the content is what makes it more
or less rigorous. In addition, when the same kind of activity is embedded in
different content, it will help build and deepen different bodies of knowledge.

---
<!-- PAGE 46 -->
<div align="left">16 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

As an illustration, one of TWR’s sentence-level strategies uses the conjunc tions *because*, *but*, and *so* to encourage extended responses. The teacher gives
students a **sentence stem**, which is an independent clause, and asks them to
finish it in three different ways, using each of the three conjunctions.

If you’re reading *The Real Story of Stone Soup*¹⁸ with young students, the
activity might look like this:

The uncle believes the boys are lazy because **he thinks he does all
the work.**

The uncle believes the boys are lazy, but **the boys really do all the
work.**

The uncle believes the boys are lazy, so **he calls them mean names
and complains about them.**

In math, instead of asking, “Why is the square root of two irrational?” you
can give your students the same activity embedded in that content:

The square root of two is irrational because **two is a non-square
number.**

The square root of two is irrational, but **the value can be approximated
on the number line.**

The square root of two is irrational, so **it cannot be written as a ratio
of two integers.**

Here’s that same activity adapted to a high-school global history class:

The Mongol Empire collapsed because **it was too large to control.**

The Mongol empire collapsed, but **areas in Russia remained under
Mongol control for centuries.**

The Mongol Empire collapsed, so **trade declined between Asia and
the Middle East.**

---
<!-- PAGE 47 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 17</div>

If you’re teaching science, the activity might go like this:

Wind energy is a sustainable resource because **it does not require fuel.**

Wind energy is a sustainable resource, but **it can be harmful to some
wildlife.**

Wind energy is a sustainable resource, so **more companies are
investing in wind turbines.**

In each of these cases, students need to return to the material they have
been studying and look carefully for information to complete the stems. The
activity can be challenging. If you think sentence-level activities are just for
elementary students, try finishing this stem: “Immanuel Kant believed that
space and time are subjective forms of human sensibility, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

No matter what content you use with these kinds of activities, the specific ity of the prompts makes them far more powerful than an open-ended ques tion such as, “Why did the Mongol Empire collapse?” The conjunction *but*,
for example, demands that students hold two contrasting ideas in their minds
and find evidence to support one of them. Your students will be deciding how
to complete the sentence stems independently, but in a way that gives them
the structure they need to engage in focused, rigorous thinking.

### Principle 5: Grammar Is Best Taught in
### the Context of Student Writing

Research has found that students who have a better understanding of gram mar are better writers.¹⁹ But it has also consistently found that teaching the
rules in isolation doesn’t work. That doesn’t mean teachers can’t, or shouldn’t,
teach grammar. As we’ve seen over the years, what does work is to teach
writing conventions and grammar in the context of students’ own writing.²⁰

Just as skills developed in writing about one subject may not transfer to
another, many students won’t be able to apply rules they’ve learned in the
abstract to their own writing. Although it’s useful for students to have a
general familiarity with basic concepts such as **noun** and **verb**, that won’t
necessarily prevent them from writing “sentences” that lack one or the other.

---
<!-- PAGE 48 -->
<div align="left">18 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Some people swear by sentence diagramming—often, those who feel that
they themselves learned to write by using the technique. And it may work
for some students. But for many, and especially those who struggle with lan guage, breaking sentences into their component parts, labeling them as parts
of speech, and plotting them on a diagram just adds to the confusion.

TWR’s method doesn’t teach grammar for the sake of teaching grammar.
You won’t find, for example, lessons on prepositional phrases and their use—
although students will undoubtedly be using such phrases in their writing.
Instead, students are taught a select number of grammatical terms and func tions that appear frequently in written language but rarely in conversation.
Students need to become familiar with these grammatical concepts to become
proficient writers—and readers.

That’s why TWR strategies focus on teaching students how to do things
like use **appositives**, which are phrases used to describe nouns, and use
**subordinating conjunctions** to introduce **dependent clauses**. Those gram matical terms are discussed in Chapter 4 and found in the glossary. They can
serve as a kind of shorthand when teachers are giving feedback. Instead of
vague feedback such as “Vary your sentence structure,” teachers can say “Add
an appositive”—and be confident that students will understand what to do
and how it will improve their writing.

### Principle 6: The Two Most Important
### Phases of the Writing Process Are
### Planning and Revising

When students are ready to tackle longer pieces of writing—paragraphs and
compositions—they’ll need to go through four steps before producing a final
copy: planning, drafting, revising, and editing. But the critical phases are
planning and revising.

All students need to plan before they write. This is especially true of
expository writing. Although experienced writers may be able to turn out
a well-developed paragraph or essay on the fly, most of the students we
work with find it overwhelming to organize their thoughts at the same time
that they’re choosing words and figuring out the best way to structure their

---
<!-- PAGE 49 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 19</div>

sentences. They may forget what they were planning to say next, or they may
need to check to see if they’re repeating themselves. Again, this is a matter of
having too many things to juggle in working memory.

Partly as a result, beginning or non-expert writers may simply put down
whatever comes into their heads about a given topic. Here, for example, is
how one sixth grader explained his strategy in writing an essay:

> I have a whole bunch of ideas and write them down till my supply of ideas is
> gone. Then I might try to think of more ideas up to the point where you can’t
> get any more ideas that are worth putting down on paper and then I would
> end it.²¹

Expert writers, on the other hand, decide on their purpose before they
begin to write: who their audience is, what they want a reader to learn, and
what ideas they want to introduce. They make a plan, listing the points they
want to include and the order in which to present them. They may show an
outline or draft to a reader or editor and find that they need to modify it.
As they try to make their explanations clearer, they may come up with new
insights and make new connections between their ideas.

Even young children can learn how to outline paragraphs with a teacher’s
guidance, if the activity is done orally and collaboratively. In one first-grade
classroom using the Hochman Method, a teacher led the children through
outlining a paragraph about how they successfully planted seeds and grew
vegetables. That kind of activity fosters logical thinking and analytical abilities
in a cognitively manageable way, preparing the groundwork for later inde pendent writing.

For students who are ready to engage in this process in written form, we
provide multiple basic outline templates: one for planning paragraphs and
several for planning compositions. The lion’s share of the work of writing
occurs at the planning stage, as students identify the main idea or theme of
their writing, the points they will make, and the order they will make them
in. As they do this work, students are discovering what further information or
clarification they need, making the necessary connections between ideas or
claims and relevant details or evidence and ensuring that they don’t wander
off into irrelevancy or repetition.

---
<!-- PAGE 50 -->
<div align="left">20 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Once students have a well-organized outline, it’s usually a simple matter
to translate it into a rudimentary draft. Then comes the next major phase
of writing: revising the draft so that it reads smoothly and coherently. This
is where students will draw on the sentence-level skills they’ve acquired,
which include using subordinating conjunctions and appositives to vary their
sentence structure and inserting transition words and phrases to make their
sentences and paragraphs flow.

---

Teachers who adhere to these six principles while implementing TWR have
found it to be a powerful way not only of teaching writing skills, but also
of ensuring their students are grasping content and thinking analytically.
They’ve learned to give students clear, explicit writing instruction and
feedback, using sentence-level activities regardless of what grade or subject
they’re teaching. They ground the TWR strategies in whatever content
the class is learning, enabling students to deal with text more effectively
and using the complexity of the content to ratchet up the activities’ rigor.
Teachers provide instruction in the correct use of grammar, punctuation,
capitalization, and other conventions by embedding those practices within
the assignments they give students. And they break the writing process into
manageable steps, with particular attention to planning and revising, so that
students don’t become overwhelmed by all the factors that writing requires
them to juggle.

## How to Use This Book

*The Writing Revolution 2.0* will guide you through a carefully scaffolded
sequence of strategies and accompanying activities that you can adapt to
any content area, grade level, or ability level. Whether you’re teaching large
classes, small groups, or tutorials, you’ll be able to find many ways to use
them. The activities also easily lend themselves to differentiation, enabling
you to modify them for a range of ability levels within your classroom.

This book provides you with numerous examples of how the strategies
can be implemented, along with a glossary of key terms at the end and an
appendix of resources. As a reminder, you’ll also find additional resources,
including customizable templates, sample activities, posters, and sample
pacing guides, at www.thewritingrevolution.org/resources/book-resources.

## Key Points

Before we describe the organization of the book, we’d like to highlight some
points that you should keep in mind as you read it.

*   We use the term **strategy** to refer to an overarching technique and
    the word **activity** to refer to scaffolds that support instruction in the
    strategy. For example, summarizing is a strategy, whereas giving
    students an article and having them write a sentence that summarizes
    it is an activity that supports it.
*   Every strategy and many of the supporting activities begin with
    a bulleted list explaining WHY it is important for you to provide
    explicit instruction for these techniques.
*   Although this book presents the strategies one after another in a
    linear sequence, in practice you’ll be using *several different strategies*
    at the same time. For example, you might first ask students to write a
    one-sentence summary of a news article. That sentence could become
    the topic sentence in a Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO), which could
    become the basis for the draft of a paragraph. Students don’t have to
    master all of the sentence strategies before learning how to develop a
    Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO).
*   Follow the sequence we suggest in introducing new strategies, but *have
    students practice previously taught strategies recursively*. In particular,
    the sentence-level activities continue to be important when students
    move on to revising paragraphs and compositions.
*   When introducing a strategy, it’s best to **model an activity for the
    class and then have students practice it orally.** This is certainly true for
    younger students, but older students also need to have demonstrations
    and participate in whole-class activities. Once students understand the
    concept, you can have them try the activity on their own in writing.
*   When demonstrating a strategy for the first time, it’s also best to
    ground the activity in a topic that all students are familiar with, so
    that they’re not trying to juggle new content in working memory

---
<!-- PAGE 52 -->
<div align="left">22 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

    along with a new writing strategy. You could use a topic that has
    already been covered in class, or you could use one from outside the
    curriculum, like “winter.”
*   When you model an activity for the whole class, make sure that you’re
    displaying your work in a way that enables all students to see what
    you’re doing by using a chalkboard, whiteboard, chart paper, SMART
    Board, projector, or document camera to do this.
*   As you adapt TWR strategies and activities to the content of your
    curriculum, **always anticipate student responses** to the questions you
    pose or activities you create. It’s surprisingly easy to create an activity
    that is clear to you but confusing to students. Make sure you are
    certain about what you want your students to understand about the
    content the activity is focused on, and plan backward from there.²²
*   When we provide examples of activities, we usually include one version
    for Level 1 students and another for Level 2. These categories apply to
    students with more basic and more advanced writing skills, respectively,
    and to some extent they correspond to grade levels in terms of the
    subject matter we have used in the examples. Level 1 examples tend
    to focus on elementary-level material, and Level 2 examples focus
    on secondary-level material. However, even students in high school
    often lack basic writing skills, so we have avoided using grade-level
    designations. You will need to use your knowledge of your students’
    needs and abilities when adapting TWR activities to the content
    you’re teaching.
*   As you progress through the school year, you should be giving
    students **prompt feedback** on their writing and regularly **assessing**
    their progress to determine what strategies to focus on, how quickly to
    move through the sequence, and which students need modifications
    suited to their individual needs.
*   The Hochman Method works best when it is implemented **across
    the curriculum** in as many subject areas as possible. In secondary
    schools and elementary schools where different subjects are taught
    by different teachers, this approach requires coordination among
    teachers and common planning time. To facilitate collaboration,
    we have provided key terms that all teachers can use as a common

<!-- PAGE 53 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 23</div>

    language and to share tips about the best ways to introduce and
    implement TWR strategies and activities. These terms are **boldfaced**
    in the text, and their definitions are found in the glossary.
*   When we use the word **differentiate**, it means *adapting* an activity to
    make it less or more challenging.

## How This Book Is Organized and
## What It Covers

This book is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on sentences
and a system of note-taking. The second section addresses longer forms of
writing—paragraphs, compositions, revision, and summarizing. The third
section covers how to assess students’ writing and adapt TWR to your classes.

### Sentences

The strategies in this section will help your students understand the purpose
and structure of sentences and develop the ability to compose complex
sentences that reflect extended thinking.

They include:

*   Understand the concept of a sentence by distinguishing between
    sentences and fragments, and unscrambling words to make a sentence
*   Expand a basic **kernel sentence** with details
*   Use the four types of sentences (statements, questions, exclamations,
    and commands)
*   Develop questions
*   Extend responses using basic conjunctions (**because, but, so**)
*   Use subordinating conjunctions to reflect written language structures
*   Insert appositives to describe a noun
*   Combine two or more short sentences into a longer one
*   Use transitions to connect thoughts and sentences

These strategies will encourage students to think analytically, enable them
to give more information to a reader, and make their writing more engaging.

---
<!-- PAGE 54 -->
<div align="left">24 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

In addition, this section will introduce a system of abbreviations and sym bols your students can use to take notes on their reading. You’ll find activities
that give your students practice in converting text they have read into notes,
using key words and phrases, which they’ll later convert back into text they
write themselves. This process ensures that your students will actually process
and understand what they read, rather than merely copying it.

### Writing at Length

In this section, you’ll learn why it’s important for students to plan before they
tackle longer forms of writing. You’ll be introduced to an outlining process
that will enable your students to shape coherent paragraphs through the use
of topic sentences, supporting sentences that provide key details, and con cluding sentences. TWR’s revision activities will provide your students with
the techniques they need to make their writing flow.

We’ll also cover the powerful strategy of summarizing and then move
on to the challenges of writing compositions: selecting a topic, developing
a thesis statement, crafting introductions and conclusions as well as body
paragraphs, and incorporating quotations.

TWR covers four types of paragraphs and, ultimately, compositions:
expository, narrative, descriptive, and opinion or argumentative. We have a
separate chapter (Chapter 10) devoted to writing argumentative essays, given
the complexity of that particular genre and the emphasis that has recently
been placed on it in many state standards.

### How to Assess Writing and Adapt the Hochman
### Method to Your Classroom

The final section will guide you through the sometimes tricky process of
assessment, which involves collecting writing samples early in the school
year in order to set goals for individual students and for the class. (Bear in
mind that you’ll need to be familiar with the contents of this entire book
before you’ll be able to set those goals.) It’s important to administer similar
assessments at the middle and end of the year to see how your students are
progressing.

<!-- PAGE 55 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 1 | Introduction: Why You Need a Writing Revolution in Your Classroom 25</div>

The final two chapters provide suggestions about how to easily “revolu tionize” your existing instructional materials so that they support the TWR
strategies you are teaching. We also detail the sequence in which the strategies
should be taught.

All of the activities in this book, when embedded in content that has been
taught, are also highly effective tools for assessing students’ comprehension
and retention of material in the curriculum.

If you want your students to write good paragraphs and compositions, you
need to start building a solid foundation first—just the way you would start
building a house. In writing, that foundation consists of sentences.

The importance of spending plenty of instructional time working with sen tences can’t be stressed enough. Students need to move from writing the way

---
<!-- PAGE 62 -->
<div align="left">32 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

they speak to using the structures of written language. At one high-poverty
high school, students’ writing quality improved dramatically after just four
months of instruction in TWR sentence strategies.¹

Once students begin to construct more sophisticated sentences, they’ll
enhance not only their writing skills but also their reading comprehension.²
In addition, sentence-level work will lay the groundwork for your students’
ability to revise and edit when they tackle longer forms of writing.

To understand the value of sentence-level work, it helps to think about
the concept of working memory—the aspect of our consciousness that takes
in and tries to make sense of new information. As we’ve mentioned, the
capacity of working memory is extremely limited, and writing imposes a
heavy burden on it. Scientists refer to that kind of burden as **cognitive load**.
If students are trying to juggle too many new things in working memory at
the same time, the resulting cognitive load can prevent them from learning
to write well and from understanding, analyzing, and retaining the content
they’re writing about. The most effective way to modulate that cognitive
load is to begin writing instruction at the sentence level—and to provide
built-in guardrails that help focus students’ attention on what we want them
to absorb.

If students are unfamiliar with the topic they’re trying to write about, that
adds to cognitive load. That’s why it’s important to introduce new writing
strategies, including sentence-level ones, in the context of familiar material,
freeing up cognitive capacity for understanding and retaining the strategies.

It’s also important to bear in mind that different aspects of literacy impose
different levels of cognitive load. Listening and speaking—which are com ponents of literacy—don’t in themselves impose any cognitive load because
humans have evolved to do those things naturally. Reading and—especially—
writing, on the other hand, can impose heavy cognitive loads. That’s why it’s
important to model new strategies and have students practice them initially
as a whole class, with the teacher’s guidance.

At the same time, the concept of cognitive load helps explain how
sentence-level work lays the crucial foundation for writing at length. As
we mentioned, if you have knowledge of the topic you’re writing about, that
will lessen your cognitive load. But it’s also important to have knowledge
of how to do things like vary your sentence structure or use certain words

---
<!-- PAGE 63 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 2 | Sentences: Learning the Fundamentals 33</div>

to connect your thoughts. When students acquire that kind of knowledge
through repeated practice with sentence-level activities, they have more
cognitive capacity available for the many other aspects of writing that come
into play when they’re writing at length.

Another benefit of sentence-level instruction is that it can familiarize
students with the complex syntax of written language. Reading complex text
aloud to students and ensuring they’re hearing the sentences can help—but
it’s even more powerful to teach students how to use those structures in their
own writing.

Almost all the sentence-level strategies described in this book build and
deepen knowledge. In fact, they do that even more effectively than lengthier
writing assignments for inexperienced or struggling writers, who may be so
overwhelmed by the mechanical demands of writing that they lack the capac ity to focus on the meaning of what they’re trying to write about.

Sentence-level work can also enable students to construct sentences that
are informative, complex, and interesting. Many students, when asked to
compose a sentence, may write something like this:

> He led the Salt March.

The goal of TWR sentence-level strategies and the activities that support
them is to enable students to write something more like this:

> In 1930, Gandhi, a political and spiritual leader, led the Salt March to protest
> Great Britain’s tax policies.

The second sentence has an **appositive** and is expanded to answer the
questions *who, when,* and *why*. If you teach all these elements explicitly
through TWR sentence-level strategies, your students will be able to con struct far more sophisticated and informative responses. The second sentence
also demonstrates far more content knowledge than the first one.

In this chapter, we’ll describe activities that help students understand some
basic sentence-level concepts. In later chapters, we’ll cover activities that help
students learn to craft more complex sentences.

## What Makes a Sentence a
## Sentence? Correcting
## Fragments, Scrambled Sentences,
## and Run-Ons

> **WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-DEFINING AND WORD-ORDERING?**
>
> *   Helps students understand the concept of a complete sentence and
>     discern sentence boundaries
> *   Helps students understand correct word order
> *   Provides practice with capitalization, punctuation, and using new
>     spelling and vocabulary words
> *   Can serve as a comprehension check
> *   Helps more proficient students understand the meanings of subjects,
>     predicates, and prepositional phrases
> *   Encourages careful reading and proofreading

A sentence consists of a group of words that includes a **subject** and a **pred icate** and expresses a complete thought. Younger students and those who
haven’t yet developed good writing skills often struggle with the concept
of a complete sentence. Everyone uses sentence fragments or incomplete
sentences in spoken language, and students may continue to use them as
they learn to write.

A **fragment** is a group of words that is not a grammatically complete
sentence. Usually a fragment lacks a subject, verb, or both (e.g., “went shop ping” or “to the store”), or it is a dependent clause that is not connected to an
independent clause (e.g., “After I do my homework”).

As we mentioned earlier, simply giving students these definitions isn’t
likely to help them write complete sentences. For many students, definitions
are too abstract. They need to spend time hearing and reading complete
sentences alongside sentence fragments and distinguishing between the two.
Teachers also need to ask their students questions about fragments that will
guide them to turn the fragments into complete sentences.

---
<!-- PAGE 65 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 2 | Sentences: Learning the Fundamentals 35</div>

When you introduce your students to the concept of a complete sentence
as opposed to a fragment, explain that while fragments may be fine in conver sation, writing requires more precision. Help students understand that need
for precision by giving them examples of sentence fragments and asking them
what element is missing. Your students may need a lot of practice working
with examples you provide before they can recognize fragments in their own
writing.

### Laying the Groundwork:
### Fixing Fragments Orally

Initially, when you give examples of fragments, it’s best to present them orally
rather than in writing. For example, you might say to the class:

> ran to the park

With Level 1 students, avoid using technical grammatical terms such as
**subject** and **predicate**, which may just confuse them. To guide them to supply
a subject, you could ask, “Does that tell us *who* ran to the park? We need to
know how to make these words into a complete sentence.”

If you’re teaching Level 2 students, you might say, “The subject (or predi cate) is missing in this fragment. Can you make it into a complete sentence?”

Another example could be:

> Sam and Dan

You might say, “We need to know *what they did*. Let’s make this fragment
into a complete sentence.” Students would then supply a verb (such as *ran*)
and perhaps a predicate (*ran to the park*) to create a sentence.

If you give your students examples of fragments orally that are related to
the content they’re studying, it will have the added advantage of deepening
their knowledge of the content. These examples can be more or less challeng ing, depending on the complexity of the content and the knowledge demands
of the fragment you choose to give them.

---
<!-- PAGE 66 -->
<div align="left">36 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

When you make up fragments, it’s important to **anticipate the correct
responses** and be sure that your students have the knowledge they need to
repair them. When they retrieve that knowledge, they’ll be further reinforc ing it in long-term memory.

#### Level 1 Example

If you’ve been teaching your students about the civil rights movement,
and you’re not sure of their grasp of the material, you might give them this
fragment:

> helped organize freedom summer

Your students could then draw on the content they’ve learned to turn the
fragment into a sentence, such as the following:

> Fannie Lou Hamer helped organize Freedom Summer.

#### Level 2 Example

If you’re teaching a class on World War I and you want to assess what your
students learned about the long-term impact of the Treaty of Versailles, you
might give them this fragment:

> contributed to the rise of fascist regimes

Your students may respond with the following:

> The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles contributed to the rise of fascist
> regimes.

### Writing Activities with Fragments

Once your students know how to distinguish fragments from sentences
through oral practice, have them practice with written examples.

---
<!-- PAGE 67 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 2 | Sentences: Learning the Fundamentals 37</div>

#### Fragments or Sentences?

Begin by giving your students a list that includes fragments and complete
sentences, and tell them to mark the sentences with an *S* and the fragments
with an *F*. Have them add correct capitalization and punctuation to the sen tences. They should then convert the fragments into complete sentences with
appropriate capitalization and punctuation. **When creating the list, be care ful not to capitalize or punctuate either the fragments or the sentences.**

If you’ve been teaching your students about Greek mythology, you could
give them a list such as the following. After marking these examples *F* or *S*,
students should convert the fragments into sentences and add the correct
punctuation and capitalization to the sentences.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write *S* if the words form a complete sentence. Capitalize and
> punctuate the sentences. Write *F* if the words are a sentence fragment. Change the
> fragments into sentences with correct capitalization and punctuation.
>
> 1.  **F** built a labyrinth for king minos
>     **Daedalus built a labyrinth for King Minos.**
>
> 2.  **F** daedalus and his son
>     **Daedalus and his son were imprisoned by King Minos of Crete.**
>
> 3.  **S** icarus was excited to be free
>     **Icarus was excited to be free.**
>
> 4.  **F** destroyed icarus’s wings
>     **The heat of the sun destroyed Icarus’s wings.**

<!-- PAGE 68 -->
<div align="left">38 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Changing Fragments to Sentences

A science teacher might want to review the periodic table and also help
students reinforce their understanding of sentences. She might give them the
following two fragments and ask them to change them into sentences with
proper punctuation and capitalization:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Change the fragments to complete sentences, adding correct
> capitalization and punctuation.
>
> 1.  the periodic table
>     **The periodic table is an organized array of elements.**
>
> 2.  has atomic number 56
>     **Barium has atomic number 56.**

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> Keep the following points in mind when you’re creating sentence fragment
> activities for your students:
>
> *   Don’t capitalize or punctuate either the fragments or the sentences. For ex ample, give students the fragment “beyond the forest” rather than “Beyond
>     the forest.” Give them the sentence “beyond the forest there was a clearing”
>     rather than “Beyond the forest, there was a clearing.” Capitalizing and punc tuating only the sentences would give away which examples are which!
> *   Be careful not to use commands (e.g., “run quickly”) when you’re giving
>     students examples of fragments. Commands can be complete sentences.
>     If you’re not sure whether an example could be a command, try doing the
>     “please” test: if you can put “please” in front of it and have it make sense, it’s
>     a command.
> *   Avoid using kernel sentences (e.g., “they argued”) as examples of fragments
>     because they are complete sentences.
> *   If you give students a fragment that you intend to be a subject, don’t include
>     a verb (e.g., “Nelson Mandela was”).

---
<!-- PAGE 69 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 2 | Sentences: Learning the Fundamentals 39</div>

> *   If you give students a fragment that you intend to be a predicate, include the
>     verb (e.g., “was the mythological founder of Rome”).
> *   Start with fragments that just have subjects or predicates; hold off on using
>     prepositional phrases (“on the ship”) or dependent clauses (“after the study
>     was published”).
> *   Make sure your students already have been exposed to the information they
>     will need to complete sentence fragments.
> *   Don’t just lift a fragment directly from a sentence in a text students have
>     read. That would turn the activity into a fill-in-the-blank exercise rather than
>     one that requires them to retrieve information and put it in their own words.
> *   Before creating a fragment, first create the anticipated response you would
>     like students to develop from the fragment.

#### Differentiating Fragment Activities

If some of your students need extra support:

*   Capitalize the proper nouns.
*   Use only subjects and predicates as fragments initially.

### Solve the Puzzle: Unscrambling
### Scrambled Sentences

Rearranging jumbled groups of words into coherent sentences helps students
grasp several fundamental concepts: the nature of a complete sentence, the
order in which words should be sequenced, and the rules of punctuation
and capitalization. When the activity is embedded in curriculum content,
students also will be deepening their understanding of that content and of
new vocabulary words they’ve learned.

Scrambled sentences can include statements, questions, and exclamations,
but should avoid commands. With commands—such as “Get the book”—the
subject (*you*) is implied rather than stated explicitly, and that can be confusing.

---
<!-- PAGE 70 -->
<div align="left">40 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Use between four and six words per sentence for Level 1 students and
between seven and ten words for Level 2 students. As with fragment activ ities, you should generally not include any capitalization or punctuation in
your scrambled groups of words.

Here are some examples of scrambled sentences with anticipated student
responses. In the Level 1 examples, we’ve put the first word in bold as an

### Put the Brakes On:
### Correcting Run-On Sentences

**Run-on sentences** are seen frequently in student writing. There’s no quick
solution, but there are a few effective ways to help students become aware of
run-ons and learn how to correct them.

Try putting a run-on sentence on the board daily, preferably embedded in
content or relating to a subject students have already learned about. First, ask
a student to read the sentence aloud, without pausing, and then ask the class
what’s wrong with it. After doing this a few times, you can just put run-ons on
the board and have students correct them without hearing them read aloud.
Continue to do this as a daily warm-up activity until students start correcting
them in their writing.

---
<!-- PAGE 72 -->
<div align="left">42 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

For example, if you are reading *Bridge to Terabithia*³, you could give stu dents the following run-on sentence to correct:

> Leslie showed Jess the kingdom of Terabithia, it was a magical place in the
> woods where they could be themselves, they were king and queen of this
> land, it was their escape from the real world.

If the word *and* is the biggest culprit in the run-ons your students write,
tell them to go back and look at every *and* they’ve put into a sentence. Then
have them ask themselves whether they’re joining two ideas that should be in
separate sentences.

Another technique that could help is to give students a list of sentences,
some of which are run-ons. Have them identify the run-ons and divide them
into sentences.

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   Embed sentence activities in the content you’re teaching as much as possible
>     to check students’ comprehension and deepen their understanding.
> *   Use sentence activities to teach grammar and conventions.
> *   When introducing a new activity, begin by modeling it and having students
>     practice it orally.
> *   Have students practice activities with sentence fragments, scrambled sen tences, and run-on sentences to help them grasp the concept of a complete
>     sentence.
> *   When assigning sentence fragments, be sure that students have the informa tion they need to turn the fragments into complete sentences.

### CHAPTER 3
# Sentence Expansion
# and Note-Taking
## Elaborating on Information

> As part of a tenth-grade science unit on climate change, Mr. Yates had assigned his
> class an article about using biofuels instead of fossil fuels. He had found the article
> on a website that offered science texts at a high school level, and, after reading it
> himself, he thought his students would find it engaging.
>
> The article explained that biofuels, which are made from plants, are thought to be
> more climate-friendly than fossil fuels. But, in fact, as the article detailed, many
> biofuels end up being just as bad for the climate, if not worse, because a lot of fossil
> fuel is required to produce them.
>
> The next day, Mr. Yates gave his students a do-now question at the beginning of
> class to assess their understanding of the article: “Why are the most commonly used
> biofuels not climate-friendly?”
>
> The answers were disappointing. “They make the earth warmer,” a student named
> Michelle wrote, with no further explanation. A few students wrote responses that
> were impressively complete, but Mr. Yates noted they were all strikingly similar. He
> then realized why: students had simply copied their sentences from the article.

How can a teacher like Mr. Yates help his students truly understand what they
read—and demonstrate their understanding in writing? It’s often not enough
to merely ask them a question about a text they’ve read. They may need to
be taught how to engage in activities that require them to think analytically
about the content of the text and enable them to craft responses that reflect
their thinking. Two such strategies are sentence expansion and note-taking,
both of which we’ll describe in this chapter.

<div align="left">46 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

## Expanding Students’
## Knowledge and Responses

> **WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES?**
>
> *   Enables students to anticipate what a reader needs to know and then
>     to provide that information
> *   Checks comprehension
> *   Teaches note-taking strategies (key words and phrases, abbreviations,
>     and symbols)
> *   Develops the ability to summarize
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge

Sentence expansion is one of the best techniques available to help students
process new information in a manageable way, enabling them both to under stand it and to transfer it to long-term memory. It can also help them gauge
what information they need to include to make their writing intelligible to a
reader who lacks extensive prior knowledge of the subject.

**HERE’S HOW SENTENCE EXPANSION WORKS:**

1.  Give your students a brief—but complete—sentence called a **kernel
    sentence**. At the same time, select appropriate question words for
    them to respond to from this list: *who, what, when, where, why,*
    and *how*.
2.  Then have your students provide answers to those question words in
    the form of notes. (In the second part of this chapter, we’ll cover how
    to help students acquire the skill of note-taking.)
3.  Finally, have students convert those notes into a complete sentence.

---
<!-- PAGE 77 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 3 | Sentence Expansion and Note-Taking: Elaborating on Information 47</div>

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> It sprouts.
>
> What? **seed**
>
> When? **after it gets water + sunlight**
>
> Where? **soil**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: After it gets water and sunlight, a seed sprouts in
> the soil.**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> Mesopotamians built ziggurats.
>
> When? **ancient times**
>
> Where? **center of city-states**
>
> Why? **provide earthly homes for gods & goddesses**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: In ancient times, Mesopotamians built ziggurats at
> the center of city-states to provide earthly homes for gods and goddesses.**

<div align="left">48 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### Creating a Kernel Sentence

To familiarize your students with the concept of sentence expansion, use a
simple, declarative sentence as your example of a kernel sentence. It should
have only one verb and no modifiers. You might use something like “Jane
ran.” or “The candidates will debate.” As with the other strategies, when you
introduce it, it’s not necessary to embed the example in the content you’re
teaching. It is important, though, to use a kernel that’s grounded in a topic
your students have knowledge about.

When creating kernel sentences, make sure that you’re not using a sentence
fragment or omitting an object. To get the most out of this exercise—especially
later when you embed it in content—**the kernel must be a complete sentence.**
“She enjoys,” for example, is not a sentence and can’t be used as a kernel—it
doesn’t express a complete thought. **Avoid using commands**, such as “Run fast,”
because students may have trouble determining who or what the subject is.

### Choosing Question Words

It’s helpful to post a chart of the question words at eye level in your classroom.
The questions words should be listed in the order shown in Exhibit 3.1:

<!-- Image of Exhibit 3.1 would go here. -->
<!-- It shows a vertical list of question words: Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why?, How? each in a different color and large font. -->
**Exhibit 3.1**

<!-- PAGE 79 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 3 | Sentence Expansion and Note-Taking: Elaborating on Information 49</div>

Sentence expansion may seem simple, but it requires writers to put them selves in the place of the reader and figure out what the reader needs to know.

**KEEP IN MIND THE FOLLOWING TIPS WHEN DEVELOPING
SENTENCE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES:**

*   **You don’t need to use all the question words with each kernel.**
    When introducing the sentence expansion strategy, it’s a good idea to
    present just one, two, or three.
*   **The question words *when, where,* and *why* are the best to use when
    introducing kernel sentences to Level 1 students.**
*   **The teacher should ALWAYS be the one to supply the question
    words—not the students.** However, when writing independently,
    students should be able to expand sentences by selecting the
    question words they believe will give the reader the most relevant
    information.
*   **The question words you choose will depend on the kernel you’re
    using and the information you want your students to add.** For
    example, if you use the kernel “Jim ran,” you won’t use the question
    word *who*, because the reader already knows the answer. However,
    if the kernel is “He ran,” it would make sense to use the question
    word *who*.
*   **The question words *who* and *what* will always correspond to a
    pronoun in the kernel.** If you write the kernel, “It sank,” the response
    to the question word *what* would be, “the Titanic.” Try to use only one
    pronoun in a kernel.
*   **Students need to have enough information about the topic to
    expand the sentence.** If they don’t know anything about the *Titanic*,
    for example, they won’t know what “It” refers to in the kernel “It
    sank.” They will also need the information required to answer the
    question words.

---
<!-- PAGE 80 -->
<div align="left">50 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

*   **When expanding a sentence, students should begin it with the
    response to *when*.** This gives them practice with a construction that is
    common in writing but not in speech.
*   **When expanding sentences, students should not add information
    beyond what is included in the kernel or in their responses to
    question words. They should also not delete information from the
    kernel.**
*   **The question word *how* can indicate a response that is an adverb:**

    > Ailish walked into the house *slowly*.

    **Or it can describe how something is done (by):**

    > Sarah figured out the answer *by* using her calculator.

> **TECHNICAL TIP**
>
> Formatting counts! When your students provide written answers to the question
> words you give them, they will be writing in note form rather than complete
> sentences. That means you’ll need to provide them with worksheets that have
> **dotted** lines after the question words.
>
> In TWR, **dotted lines are *always* used for notes (key words and phrases,
> abbreviations, and symbols), and solid lines are *always* used for complete
> sentences.** Make sure your students understand the difference between what
> is expected on the dotted lines and the solid ones. We describe how to provide
> instruction in writing notes in the following section.
>
> Students’ expanded sentences need to be grammatically correct, with appropriate
> capitalization and punctuation.

## Examples of Sentence
## Expansion in Content

Once your students have the idea of sentence expansion, it’s time to give
them a sentence expansion activity that’s embedded in content you’re
currently teaching. You have to decide what you want your students to learn
from the activity, anticipate their responses, and assess whether they have
enough knowledge to produce the responses you’re looking for.

Always remind your students that they should begin to expand with *when*
if it is one of the question words.

### English

If you’re reading *Animal Farm*¹ by George Orwell, you might consider the
following activity:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> He called a meeting.
>
> Who? **Old Major**
>
> When? **3 days b/4 he died**
>
> Where? **Manor Farm**
>
> Why? **encourage animals to revolt**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: Three days before he died, Old Major called a
> meeting at Manor Farm to encourage the animals to revolt.**

<div align="left">52 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### Math

If you’re teaching math and covering the distributive property, you might give
your students the following problem:

> 2(x + 6) = 14

Then you could give students a hypothetical student’s answer along with
the kernel:

> She made a mistake.

Students would then have to answer the question words *who, when,* and
*why*. The resulting expanded sentence might look like what is shown here:

> **Jasmine’s Work**
>
> Problem: 2(x + 6) = 14
>
> Step 1: 2x + 6 = 14
>
> Step 2:
> ```
>  2x + 6 = 14
>   – 6 = – 6
>  –––––––––
>     2x =  8
> ```
> Answer:
> ```
>  2x   8
>  –– = ––
>   2   2
>
>   x = 4
> ```
>
> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> She made a mistake.
>
> Who? **Jasmine**
>
> When? **Step 1**
>
> Why? **didn’t distribute 2 to both terms inside ( )**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: In step 1, Jasmine made a mistake because she didn’t
> distribute the 2 to both of the terms inside the parentheses.**

### History

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> She became pharaoh.
>
> Who? **Hatshepsut**
>
> When? **after husband died**
>
> Why? **b/c stepson too young to rule Egypt**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: After her husband died, Hatshepsut became pharaoh
> because her stepson was too young to rule Egypt.**

### Science

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence.
>
> They make good barriers.
>
> What? **lipids**
>
> Where? **around cells**
>
> Why? **non-polar**
>

of why, when, and how to use this strategy.

## The Power of Note-Taking:
## Key Words and Phrases,
## Abbreviations, and Symbols

We often assume that students will just figure out how to take notes efficiently,
but that’s not always the case. Considering how frequently we’re required to
take notes throughout our lives, we believe that giving students a solid founda tion in note-taking will benefit them in multiple ways. That foundation should
include teaching students how to identify important words and phrases and
how to use symbols and abbreviations. Many students need explicit instruction
in how to distill information into note form, using abbreviations and symbols.

> **WHY PRACTICE NOTE-TAKING?**
>
> *   Helps students distinguish essential from nonessential material
> *   Boosts comprehension
> *   Enables the absorption and retention of information
> *   Promotes analytical thinking
> *   Enables students to outline paragraphs and compositions before
>     drafting them

Converting text or speech to notes is one of the most valuable skills
you can teach your students. It’s far more than just a quick way to get infor mation down on paper—although it does serve that purpose. It’s a way of
enabling students to process and understand what they’ve read, heard, and
learned.

Changing sentences to notes requires students to extract the most import ant words and phrases and render them in a different mode of expression.
That exercise prevents rote copying, ensures comprehension, and promotes
absorption and retention of information. For more information on these
benefits of note-taking, see the Ask the Experts section.

---
<!-- PAGE 89 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 3 | Sentence Expansion and Note-Taking: Elaborating on Information 59</div>

Learning to identify key words and phrases in a text and reduce them to
notes is also a crucial step in the Hochman Method. Your students will need
to know how to use key words and phrases to respond to the question words
you provide for sentence expansion activities. They’ll use the same technique
to produce outlines for paragraphs and compositions—and to take notes on
their reading or what they’re learning in class.

As students gain more experience, they will create their own unique
note-taking style. However, initially it’s crucial to introduce them to specific
techniques and give them plenty of practice with them.

**Note-taking is not only a valuable skill; it’s also a powerful way to boost
comprehension and reinforce knowledge.**

### Introducing Students to Note-Taking

As with all TWR activities, when you’re introducing students to note-taking,
model the activity first. Although it’s not essential to embed the sentences in
the content of the curriculum at this point, it will provide an opportunity to
boost students’ learning when you do—assuming it’s content that has already
been covered.

The following sequence for modeling note-taking activities can be done
with the whole class. Each step can be followed by independent practice.
(The example below would be appropriate for students in fourth grade and up.
For grades 1–3, only key words and phrases should be used for notes—not
symbols and abbreviations.)

1.  **Underline key words and phrases in a sentence.** (Be sure the
    sentence has several substantive words and phrases.)

    The <u>magma chamber</u> is a <u>zone of molten rock</u>.
2.  **Convert a sentence into notes.**

    The magma chamber is a zone of molten rock.

    **magma chamber = zone/molten rock**

---
<!-- PAGE 90 -->
<div align="left">60 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

3.  **Convert given notes into a sentence.**

    ↑ gases → magma blasting through Earth’s surface
    
    **The increase of gases leads to magma blasting through
    Earth’s surface.**

Introduce your students to common abbreviations such as *b/c* for *because*,
*w/* for *with*, and *w/o* for *without*. Remind them that when they’re writing
notes, they should omit words such as *the, and,* and *a*.

The following chart lists some of the most frequently used symbols. Note
that the = sign can also be used to indicate an appositive.

<!-- PAGE 91 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 3 | Sentence Expansion and Note-Taking: Elaborating on Information 61</div>

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> *   Don’t try to teach students to underline and take notes from texts with
>     simple, unelaborated sentences. In these materials, often many of the words
>     and sentences are equally meaningful, making the task of identifying the
>     most important ideas or words impossible. This is especially true of material
>     that has been adapted for younger or struggling readers.
> *   When using abbreviations and symbols, make sure you don’t use slashes to
>     break up a thought cluster. For example, you would not want students to

>
>     **INCORRECT NOTE-TAKING:**
>
>     Continental Congress = meeting/of/states

We’re not providing Level 1 examples of note-taking activities because
Level 1 students should mainly use key words and phrases under a teacher’s
guidance, when engaging in sentence expansion activities and creating
Single-Paragraph Outlines. The latter are described in detail in Chapter 6.

#### Level 2 Examples

> **DIRECTIONS:** Change the sentences into notes (key words, phrases, abbreviations,
> and symbols).
>
> 1.  The assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria, led to World War I.
>     **assassination of Franz Ferdinand = archduke of Austria → WWI**
>
> 2.  At the beginning of World War I, the Allies were France, the United Kingdom, and
>     Russia, while the Central Powers were Germany and Austria-Hungary.
>     **beg. of WWI/Allies = France, UK, + Russia/Central Powers =
>     Germany + Austria-Hungary**

### CHAPTER 4
# Sentences
## Introducing Variety and Complexity

> At the beginning of the school year, Mr. White gave his third graders a prompt to get
> a sense of their writing ability: “Please write a paragraph about the best part of your
> summer.”
>
> The response from Lola in Exhibit 4.1 was pretty typical.

<!-- Image of Exhibit 4.1 would go here -->
<!-- It shows a handwritten paragraph on lined paper:
Directions: Please write a paragraph about the best part of your summer.
I got to stay at home. I got to
wath TV! I got to play the swith!
I got to play on my mommy’s ipad.
I got to go to bed at 10:30 and 11:30!
I got play with my favrite toys!
I got to Davie and Busters! -->
**Exhibit 4.1**

> Mr. White tried to focus on the positive. Lola had written complete sentences, and
> she’d spelled most of the words correctly. Her capitalization and punctuation were
> also exemplary, and she had even used an apostrophe. In addition, the entire
> paragraph was focused on the topic of the prompt.
>
> On the other hand, the sentences in Lola’s paragraph all had the same simple
> structure. One ended in an exclamation point instead of a period, but that was about
> it for variety. Basically, her paragraph was just a list.

---
<!-- PAGE 98 -->
<div align="left">68 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

> In previous years, Mr. White had tried to help his students create more complex
> sentences, but his suggestions—for example, not to end almost every sentence with
> an exclamation point—hadn’t had much effect.
>
> He had also tried encouraging students to create sentences that were more like
> those in the children’s literature they read, but they didn’t seem to know how to do
> that. In fact, it wasn’t always clear they understood those complex sentences.

The fact is, some students may not know how to vary their sentence structure
unless they’ve been explicitly introduced to different types of sentences and
how to use them. Once they’re aware of the possibilities, they’re in a much
better position to create engaging prose that incorporates a range of struc tures, including complex sentences with multiple clauses.

And, as we’ve mentioned, teaching students how to construct complex sen tences can also boost their reading comprehension.¹ Because the syntax, or
sentence structure, of written language is more complex than that of spoken
language, it’s often unfamiliar and confusing for students. Written sentences
may have multiple clauses, and the subject and verb may be separated by a lot
of other information. That can lead students to assume, for example, that the
word closest to the verb is the subject of the sentence even when it’s not.

Even children’s books often use more complex syntax than adult conver sation.² As the grade levels go up and students are expected to read texts with
increasingly complex syntax—including original historical documents—lack of
familiarity with complex syntax can pose a serious barrier to comprehension.

The following excerpts from children’s literature, a classic work of fiction,
and a historical document illustrate the complexity and length of sentences
that students may encounter and find difficult to understand.

> Next morning when the first light came into the sky and the
> sparrows stirred in the trees, when the cows rattled their chains
> and then roosters crowed and the automobiles went whispering
> along the road, Wilbur awoke and looked for Charlotte.³

The United States Declaration of Independence
<!-- Image of the Declaration of Independence -->

Lack of familiarity with complex syntax is a widespread problem. According
to one study of around 25,000 American students, only 10 percent of eighth
graders are able to “evaluate complex syntax.”⁶ It’s also a problem that isn’t
limited to historically disadvantaged groups or struggling readers. One Harvard
English professor found that when she taught *The Scarlet Letter*, her students
“were really struggling to understand the sentences as sentences—specifically,
they were having trouble identifying the subject and the verb.”⁷

Students need to learn to walk before they can run, though. Before moving
on to concepts like **subordinating conjunctions, transitions,** and **apposi tives**, let’s start with the fundamentals.

---
<!-- PAGE 100 -->
<div align="left">70 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

## The Four Basic Sentence Types

All sentences, no matter how complex, can be boiled down to these four types:

**Declarative sentence (statement)**
Sets forth an idea or argument; the most common type of sentence.
Example: **Theodore Roosevelt created five national parks.**

**Imperative sentence (command)**
Gives advice or instructions or expresses a request or an order.
Example: **Visit a national park.**

**Interrogative sentence (question)**
Makes an inquiry and always ends with a question mark.
Example: **How can the national parks be protected?**

**Exclamatory sentence (exclamation)**
Expresses force or a strong emotion and ends with an exclamation point.
Example: **National parks must be protected!**

> **WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-TYPE ACTIVITIES?**
>
> *   Enables students to vary sentence structure
> *   Provides one of the three strategies for creating topic and concluding
>     sentences
> *   Introduces students to developing questions
> *   Helps students learn correct punctuation
> *   Reinforces spelling, vocabulary, and academic knowledge

Introducing students to the four sentence types will pay off when it comes
time for them to write paragraphs and essays and you ask them to vary their
sentence structure.

---
<!-- PAGE 101 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 71</div>

### Distinguishing between
### the Sentence Types

After explaining the four different sentence types, have your Level 1 students
practice distinguishing between them. Explain that *S* stands for *statement*;
*Q*, for *question*; *E*, for *exclamation*; and *C*, for *command*. You might give them
the following activity:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the sentence type (S, Q, E, C).
>
> **S** Tony doesn’t want to go.
>
> **Q** Does Tony want to go?
>
> **E** Don’t go, Tony!
>
> **C** Go now.

You can use sentence-type activities to teach punctuation. For example,
you can give students different types of unpunctuated sentences and ask them
to add the appropriate punctuation. Tell them that commands can end with a
period or an exclamation point.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Add the correct punctuation to each sentence:
>
> Anna doesn’t want to go **.**
>
> Does Anna want to go **?**
>
> Don’t go, Anna **!**

---
<!-- PAGE 102 -->
<div align="left">72 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### Using Sentence-Type Activities to Assess
### and Reinforce Knowledge and Vocabulary

If you are teaching the word *fluctuate*, you can ask students to write each sen tence type using the word in any of its forms. They might give the following
answers:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence of each type using the word *fluctuate* in any form.
>
> Statement: **Climate change is causing extreme fluctuations in the
> weather.**
>
> Question: **What causes body temperature to fluctuate?**
>
> Exclamation: **Fluctuating weather patterns can be dangerous!**
>
> Command: **Prepare for extreme fluctuations in weather.**

Not all topics lend themselves to all four sentence types. To determine
which sentence types are appropriate for a particular activity, remember to
always anticipate student responses.

In a math class, students could write the following sentences with the word
*diagram*.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence of each type using the word *diagram*.
>
> Statement: **The diagram represents 1/2.**
>
> Question: **Is a diagram a visual representation?**
>
> Command: **Draw a diagram that has four sides and measures
> 360 degrees.**

As an alternative to putting one word into the four sentence types, consider
using several words that are relevant to what your students are studying.

---
<!-- PAGE 103 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 73</div>

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write each sentence type using the following words.
>
> register (command)
> **Register to vote.**
>
> elections (statement)
> **There are national, state, and local elections.**
>
> vote (exclamation)
> **Every vote counts!**
>
> democracy (question)
> **How are citizens represented in a democracy?**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write two statements and two questions using the following words.
>
> prophase (statement)
> **Prophase is one of the phases of mitosis.**
>
> eukaryotic cells (statement)
> **Mitosis can only occur in eukaryotic cells.**
>
> mitosis (question)
> **What are the five phases of mitosis?**
>
> chromosome (question)
> **How many chromosomes does each cell produced by mitosis have?**

#### Differentiating Sentence-Type Activities

If some of your students need extra support or an additional challenge, here
is a possible modification:

*   Ask more advanced students to create all four sentence types, while
    asking others to create only statements and questions.

---
<!-- PAGE 104 -->
<div align="left">74 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

## How to Develop Knowledge
## and Skills? A Good Question

> **WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING QUESTIONS?**
>
> *   Encourages students to think about the important features in text
> *   Encourages close reading
> *   Helps students to focus on the key elements of questions
> *   Gives students practice in understanding and using expository terms
>     (see Appendix A)
> *   Helps students anticipate what questions they may be asked
> *   Reinforces knowledge and vocabulary
> *   Develops analytical abilities

It’s as important for students to learn how to generate questions as it is
for them to learn how to answer them. When students formulate questions,
they’re developing higher-level cognitive functions while at the same time
focusing on the main idea of the content that provides the basis of their
question.

For example, imagine that you needed to formulate a question about the
paragraph you just read. You might need to read it several times, asking your self what it’s really all about. Perhaps you’d come up with the following:

> Why is it important for students to learn how to generate questions?

or:

> What skills or abilities do students develop when they formulate
> questions?

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Expository
> Writing Terms
> *Appendix A*

---
<!-- PAGE 105 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 75</div>

If you embed question activities in the content your students are learning,
you’ll encourage them to retrieve information from long-term memory, read
and reread text closely to ensure their recollection is correct, and think deeply
about what they’re learning.

### Developing Questions about Images

An excellent way of introducing your students to the skill of developing ques tions is to show them a picture and ask them to come up with two or three
questions based on what they see. If the picture is related to the content of
the curriculum—for example, a political cartoon or a depiction of a historical
event in a history class—and you ask students to write both questions and
responses, you’ll also be able to check your students’ understanding of the
material.

#### Level 1 Example

You could give your Level 1 students the following picture to practice devel oping questions when they are being introduced to the book *Ox-Cart Man*.⁸

<!-- Image of Ox-Cart Man book cover -->

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write three questions about the picture.
>
> 1.  **When does this story take
>     place?**
>
> 2.  **Why is there a cow pulling the
>     cart instead of a horse?**
>
> 3.  **What’s going to go in the cart?**

---
<!-- PAGE 106 -->
<div align="left">76 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 2 Example

You could give Level 2 math students the following activity:

<!-- Image of a math problem with shapes on a coordinate plane -->

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write three questions and answers about the picture.
>
> 1Q: **Are the shapes congruent?**
>
> 1A: **The shapes are congruent.**
>
> 2Q: **Which quadrant are both
> figures in?**
>
> 2A: **Both figures are in quadrant 1.**
>
> 3Q: **What type of transformation
> is this?**
>
> 3A: **This transformation is a
> rotation.**

### Using Expository Terms

Appendix A (“Expository Writing Terms”) lists terms that call for a specific
type of response—for example, *analyze* or *compare*. The following activity
will help students understand the different meanings of these terms when
they encounter them on tests or in text. If they’ve used the terms *enumerate*
and *summarize* in formulating their own prompts, they’re less likely to
become confused when they see directions using those terms. You can ask
your students to formulate test or assignment instructions using the exposi tory terms and then respond to them.

Depending on grade level and the content the class is studying, students
might come up with the following. Asking students to provide the answers is
optional.

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Expository
> Writing Terms
> *Appendix A*

---
<!-- PAGE 107 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 77</div>

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write three directions using the words *compare, summarize,* and
> *describe* about frogs and toads.
>
> 1: **Compare frogs and toads.**
>
> 2: **Summarize the differences between frogs and toads.**
>
> 3: **Describe the appearances of frogs and toads.**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write three directions and answers about absolute rulers using the
> words *describe, enumerate,* and *explain*.
>
> 1: **Describe the role of absolute rulers in medieval Europe.**
>
> 1A: **Absolute rulers had total control over their countries.**
>
> 2: **Enumerate possible reasons for opposition to absolute rulers.**
>
> 2A: **First, people had no political power. Second, the rulers controlled the
> practice of religion. Lastly, they had total control over the economy.**
>
> 3: **Explain why absolute rulers believed they were entitled to their power.**
>
> 3A: **Absolute rulers believed that they had a divine right to rule.**

## Conjunctions, Complexity,
## and Clauses

**Conjunctions** include words such as *because* and *but*. Using conjunctions to
connect words, phrases, and clauses provides more information for the reader
and helps make writing clear and linguistically rich.

---
<!-- PAGE 108 -->
<div align="left">78 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

A **clause** is a group of words in a sentence that contains a subject and a
verb. There are two types of clauses:

*   An **independent (main) clause** represents a complete thought and
    can stand alone as a sentence. For example, in the sentence *The teacher
    was happy because I did my homework*, The teacher was happy is an
    independent clause.
*   A **dependent (subordinate) clause** does not express a complete
    thought and could not stand alone as a complete sentence. In the
    previous example, *because I did my homework* is a dependent clause.

Conjunction activities enable students to craft more complex sentences.
As students do so, they also develop the ability to understand such sentences
when they encounter them in their reading.

### Simple but Powerful: *because, but, so*

A powerful TWR sentence activity is known as *because-but-so*. It’s a great
illustration of how an exercise that seems simple can actually require students
to think analytically.

> **WHY PRACTICE BASIC CONJUNCTIONS?**
>
> *   Develops the ability to write extended and elaborated responses
> *   Checks student comprehension
> *   Develops analytical thinking
> *   Fosters close reading
> *   Provides practice in using new vocabulary words correctly
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

This is how you should proceed: give students **sentence stems**—the
beginning of a sentence—and have the students turn them into three separate
sentences, using each conjunction. This approach requires them to engage in
far more specific and focused thinking than just asking them to respond to

---
<!-- PAGE 109 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 79</div>

an open-ended question. Think about the difference between asking students,
“Why do seeds need light to grow?” and framing the assignment as follows:

> Seeds need light to grow because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Seeds need light to grow, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Seeds need light to grow, so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Make sure your students understand the meanings of each conjunction.
You could explain it to them this way:

*   ***because*** explains why something is true, why something happened, or
    why a certain condition exists
*   ***but*** indicates a change of direction
*   ***so*** tells us what happens as a result of something else—in other words,
    a cause and its effect

As with other TWR activities, the content of *because-but-so* drives its rigor.
When you adapt the activity to the content you’re teaching, be sure to antic ipate student responses and ensure that your students have enough content
knowledge to complete the activity successfully.

In addition to guiding your students to create compound and complex
sentences, this activity will prod them to think critically and deeply about the
content they’re studying and encourage them to refer back to the text. It will
also provide you with a precise check of your students’ comprehension.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians because **it provided fertile soil for
> farming.**
>
> The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians, but **annual floodwaters caused
> destruction.**
>
> The Nile was beneficial to ancient Egyptians, so **the river was worshiped as a god.**

---
<!-- PAGE 110 -->
<div align="left">80 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

You can also use this activity to give students practice with new vocabulary
or spelling words. Embed those words in the stems you create. For example,
if your students have just learned the word *mediocre*, you can give them the
following sentence stems:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre because **the menu was limited.**
>
> The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre, but **others believed it was
> excellent.**
>
> The critic thought the restaurant was mediocre, so **he rated it 3 stars instead of
> 5 in his review.**

Depending on the content you’re teaching and the ability of your students,
you could also give students different stems about the same topic to complete
rather than the same one with all three conjunctions.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> Diversity in a gene pool is better for survival because **more favorable phenotypes
> are more likely to survive and produce offspring.**
>
> Evolution occurs slowly over long periods of time, but **that is not the case with
> bacteria resistant to antibiotics.**
>
> Populations tend to grow and exceed their limited resources, so **competition
> results in differential survival.**

With Level 1 students, practice this activity orally before having students
try it in writing. To introduce the idea, start with a simple stem embedded
in familiar content or common knowledge—for example, “The teacher

---
<!-- PAGE 111 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 81</div>

was happy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” Students might respond orally with answers such
as these:

> The teacher was happy because **we raised our hands.**
>
> The teacher was happy, but **she still gave us homework.**
>
> The teacher was happy, so **she gave us a longer recess.**

Once your students grasp the concept, embed the activity in content
you’re currently covering. If your class is studying Abraham Lincoln, you
could give students the stem, “Abraham Lincoln was a great president
because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” The activity would look like this:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> Abraham Lincoln was a great president because **he kept the country united.**
>
> Abraham Lincoln was a great president, but **critics have called him a dictator
> because of his broad use of emergency powers.**
>
> Abraham Lincoln was a great president, so **more books have been written about
> him than any other American president.**

You might just focus on one conjunction at a time with Level 1 students
by giving students two or three different stems to complete with *because*. If
students have been reading *Malala’s Magic Pencil,*⁹ you might give them the
following activity:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> Malala wished for a magic pencil because **she wanted to use it to bring peace
> to the world.**
>
> Dangerous men tried to silence Malala because **her voice became so powerful.**
>
> Malala wrote about her life because **she wanted more people to know what was
> happening to girls in her city.**

#### Differentiating Basic Conjunction Activities

You can easily modify the *because-but-so* activity to accommodate students
at different ability levels. Give all students the same stem, but ask more profi cient students to provide complete sentences for all three conjunctions while
asking others to write a sentence for only one or two.

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> Keep the following points in mind when creating and assigning *because-but-so* activities:
>
> *   **Formatting matters!** The underlined blank space for completing the stem
>     should appear on the same line as the conjunction itself, **not** on a separate line
>     below it. Otherwise, students may capitalize the word after the conjunction
>     and write another sentence instead of a clause.
>
>     **INCORRECT FORMATTING:**
>
>     The war was won because
>
>     **The colonists were determined to protect their country.**
>
>     **INCORRECT FORMATTING:**
>
>     The conjunctions should **not** be given as a list without repeating the stem:
>
>     The war was won because
>
>     but
>
>     so
>
>     Students may try to put all three conjunctions in one sentence:
>
>     **The war was won because the colonists were determined to protect
>     their country but there were many casualties so the United States
>     was able to gain its independence.**
>
> It’s important to follow the correct format for *because-but-so* activities as shown
> in the examples—supplying the stem for each sentence and following each con junction with a solid blank line that students should use to complete the sentence.

>
> *   Anticipate your students’ responses when developing activities with these conjunc tions. Always complete the stems yourself before asking your students to do so.
> *   Students should not create stems because they may omit information that is
>     important to include.
> *   Be sure students know the word *so* isn’t being used in the sense of “I admire
>     Nelson Mandela *so much*.” Instead, it introduces a phrase that tells us what
>     happened as a result of something else.
> *   Be mindful of the difference between *so* (shows cause and effect) and *so that*
>     (often gives a reason instead of a result). For example:
>     *   Hammurabi created a written code of laws **so that** he could establish
>         justice in Babylon.
>     *   Hammurabi created a written code of laws, **so** Babylon experienced a
>         period of stability.
> *   Not every text will lend itself to activities using all three conjunctions. For
>     example, if a text provides only positive information about Abraham Lincoln’s

### Adding Complexity:
### Subordinating Conjunctions

> **WHY PRACTICE SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS?**
>
> *   Promotes the use of complex sentences
> *   Improves reading comprehension by familiarizing students with
>     syntax they’ll encounter in their reading
> *   Enables students to vary sentence structure
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary
> *   Encourages close reading and references to text
> *   Checks student comprehension
> *   Enables students to extend their responses
> *   Provides a strategy for creating topic and concluding sentences

A **subordinating conjunction** is a word like *before* or *unless* that introduces
a dependent (subordinate) clause and signals the relationship between that
clause and the main idea. For example, in the sentence *Although I drank a glass
of water, I was still thirsty*, the subordinating conjunction *although* introduces a
clause relating to *I was still thirsty*. Subordinating conjunctions are often used in
written language but not as frequently in spoken language. In conversation, we
would be more likely to say *I drank a glass of water, but I was still thirsty*.

The following subordinating conjunctions are used frequently to begin sen tences in writing. They are listed in Exhibit 4.2 in the order in which they are
taught to Level 1 students (they can be taught to Level 2 students in any order):

| 1. After      | 6. Although   |
|---------------|---------------|
| 2. Before     | 7. Whenever   |
| 3. If         | 8. Since      |
| 4. When       | 9. While      |
| 5. Even though | 10. Unless    |
**Exhibit 4.2**

---
<!-- PAGE 115 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 85</div>

Subordinating conjunctions can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of
a sentence. However, it’s best to begin instruction using them at the begin ning of a sentence, which is why they’re capitalized in the preceding chart.
Once your students learn to use subordinating conjunctions, they’ll be able
to place them elsewhere. They’ll also be able to write extended responses that
are rich in complexity and content.

**When students begin writing paragraphs and essays, they can use
subordinating conjunctions to create topic or concluding sentences that
are interesting and informative.**

### Introducing Students to
### Subordinating Conjunctions

To develop your students’ skill in using subordinating conjunctions, give them
introductory dependent clauses that you’ve created and ask them to complete the
sentences. As with sentence stems using *because-but-so*, this approach demands
more analytical thinking and precision than merely asking open-ended questions.

For example, there is a significant difference between asking a student
“Why was the Industrial Revolution important?” and asking them to complete
the following stems:

> Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Before England embarked on the Industrial Revolution, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When a stem begins with *although*, students need to find contrasting or
contradictory information. If they use *before*, they need to demonstrate their
understanding of the chronology of events.

---
<!-- PAGE 116 -->
<div align="left">86 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 1 Examples

Students in primary grades can practice completing stems, either orally or in
writing, based on books you’ve introduced in read-alouds. With Level 1 stu dents, it’s best to start with conjunctions that depend on chronology (*before,
after*) or the conjunction *if*.

If you’ve been reading them the book *Chicks and Salsa,*¹⁰ for example,
you could give them the following stems, and students might provide these
answers:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem.
>
> Before the chickens made salsa, **they crept into the garden to get tomatoes
> and onions.**
>
> After the ducks were inspired by the chickens, **they took cilantro from the
> garden to make guacamole.**

If you’ve read your students the book *From Seed to Plant,*¹¹ the stems and
answers might look like these:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem.
>
> Before a flower can make seeds, **it has to be pollinated.**
>
> If a seed isn’t on or in soil, **it will not sprout.**
>
> After a seed germinates, **the root grows down into the soil.**

<!-- PAGE 117 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 87</div>

#### Level 2 Examples

If you’re teaching English and your students have been reading
*Metamorphosis,*¹² you might give them the following stems to complete, and
they might provide the answers shown:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence.
>
> Although Grete is benevolent toward Gregor, **she is repulsed by him.**
>
> Since she wants Gregor to eat, **Grete begins a monotonous feeding routine.**
>
> If Grete had not shown compassion toward Gregor, **he probably would have died
> sooner.**

When students are learning about *buoyancy* in a science class, the stems
and answers might look as follows:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete each sentence stem.
>
> If an object has a higher average density than a liquid, **the object is not buoyant
> enough to float.**
>
> When an object has a larger surface area touching a liquid, **the liquid exerts more
> upward force on the object.**

### Connecting Ideas: Transitions

> **WHY PRACTICE TRANSITION ACTIVITIES?**
>
> *   Helps students identify and show the relationship between ideas
> *   Provides logical connections between sentences, paragraphs, and
>     sections within compositions
> *   Enables students to signal how a reader should react to or process the
>     information presented
> *   Makes writing more readable and engaging
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Transitions are often called **signal words** because they signal, or indicate, a
relationship between ideas. They can make text smoother and help minimize
the confusion that brief or unelaborated statements can cause.

Explain to students that, as a general rule, when transitions appear at the
beginning of a sentence, they are followed by a comma. The term **transition**
can refer to words that appear in the middle of a sentence, but we’ll be using
the term to refer to words at the beginning of a sentence. (See Exhibit 4.3.)

> **Types of Transitions**
>
> **Time and sequence**—provide sequence of events, steps in a process
>
> **Conclusion**—express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of
> view, solution
>
> **Illustration**—give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a
> statement
>
> **Change of direction**—signal contrasting thoughts
>
> **Emphasis**—prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously
> stated

### Introducing Transitions

The best way to introduce students to transitions is through the sentence level activities we describe in this chapter. Students will eventually use transi tions to connect sentences and paragraphs.

When introducing students to transitions, begin with time-and-sequence,
conclusion, and illustration transitions.

#### Time-and-Sequence Transitions

These are transition words and phrases such as *first, second,* and *finally*.
Students will find them helpful when writing narratives that relate a chrono logical series of events or steps in a process. They are especially helpful when
explaining a solution to a math problem, describing a process in science,
writing a summary of a plot, or tracing the timeline of an event.

You may want Level 1 students to stay with simple time-and-sequence
transitions such as *first, second,* and *finally*, along with *then* and *next* (cat egory 1A in Appendix C). More advanced students can use words such as
*initially* and *previously* (category 1B in Appendix C).

One way to have students practice using transitions is to give them a
sentence followed by a transition word or phrase that introduces the next
sentence. Students can complete the second sentence in a way that fits the
transition word you’ve provided. Alternatively, you can provide the second
sentence but leave a blank space for them to supply an appropriate transition.

##### Level 1 Example

> The class trip to the Museum of Natural History was interesting. First, **we visited the
> insect exhibit.**

or

> The class trip to the Museum of Natural History was interesting. **First,** we visited the
> insect exhibit.

<!-- PAGE 121 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 91</div>

##### Level 2 Example

> There are a number of factors to consider when choosing sunglasses. Initially, **you
> need to be careful that the lenses absorb 99–100% of UVA and UVB rays.**

or

> There are a number of factors to consider when choosing sunglasses. **Initially,** you need
> to be careful that the lenses absorb 99–100% of UVA and UVB rays.

#### Conclusion Transitions

Students should use conclusion transitions to introduce the last sentence in a
paragraph or the first sentence of the concluding paragraph in a composition.

Conclusions can simply summarize the ideas in a piece of writing, in
which case a transition like *in summary* would be appropriate. Other con clusions focus on a solution or the author’s point of view. More advanced
students can practice deciding when it would be better to conclude with a
summation or a statement that goes beyond that.

Some conclusion transitions, like *as a result* and *therefore*, should be used
to introduce the endings of cause-and-effect paragraphs and compositions.
These cause-and-effect transitions are marked in Appendix C with an asterisk.

##### Level 1 Example

> Often plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in the ocean. As a result, **many sea
> animals may become extinct.**

or

> Often plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in the ocean. **As a result,** many sea
> animals may become extinct.

<div align="left">92 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

##### Level 2 Example

This example assumes students have read *Hatchet*.¹³

> The smoke from the fire keeps the mosquitoes and birds away from Brian’s shelter.
> Therefore, **he is able to maintain his food supply.**

or

> The smoke from the fire keeps the mosquitoes and birds away from Brian’s shelter.
> **Therefore,** he is able to maintain his food supply.

#### Illustration Transitions

Illustration transitions are used to give examples, to support a detail, or to
explain or elaborate on a statement with evidence. For example, one illustra tion transition is—in fact—*for example*. Illustration transitions can be intro duced to students who are at the higher end of Level 1. Younger students can
be introduced to the phrase *for example* if it’s done orally as a whole-class
activity, under a teacher’s guidance.

##### Level 1 Example

> Each of the gods had his or her area of responsibility. For example, **Apollo was the
> god of music and the sun.**

or

> Each of the gods had his or her area of responsibility. **For example,** Apollo was the god
> of music and the sun.

##### Level 2 Example

> The Agricultural Revolution changed people’s lives. Specifically, **humans began to farm
> and plant on their own fields.**

or

> The Agricultural Revolution changed people’s lives. **Specifically,** humans began to farm
> and plant on their own fields.

---
<!-- PAGE 123 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 93</div>

If you’re teaching Level 2 students who have no trouble using the three
categories of transitions just described, introduce them to two other kinds of
transitions: change of direction and emphasis.

#### Change-of-Direction Transitions

Change-of-direction transitions introduce contrasting thoughts. They are
important signals to use in compare-and-contrast as well as in argumentative
writing.

Remind students that some change-of-direction transitions, such as
*although* and *even though*, need to be used as subordinating conjunctions that
introduce a dependent clause, not a sentence. For example, “Although zoos
are popular attractions, critics believe they are cruel to the animals.”

##### Level 1 Example

> The zebra is related to a horse. However, **they are not the same species.**

or

> The zebra is related to a horse. **However,** they are not the same species.

##### Level 2 Example

> Red blood cells carry nutrients throughout the body. In contrast, **white blood cells
> fight infection.**

or

> Red blood cells carry nutrients throughout the body. **In contrast,** white blood cells fight
> infection.

---
<!-- PAGE 124 -->
<div align="left">94 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Emphasis Transitions

Emphasis transitions can be introduced at the same time as change-of direction transitions. They prove a point or statement or reaffirm something
the writer has already stated. They are often used in argumentative and
opinion writing, letters of complaint, and formal requests. These transitions
can also be used as conclusion transitions.

Consider giving Level 1 students only the following transitions: *in addition,
most importantly, in particular*.

##### Level 1 Example

> Helen liked to read in Braille. In particular, **she loved the book *Little Women*.**

or

> Helen liked to read in Braille. **In particular,** she loved the book *Little Women*.

##### Level 2 Example

This example assumes students have read *The Crucible*.¹⁴

> Dozens of people in Salem are accused of witchcraft. Notably, **Rebecca Nurse and
> John Proctor, highly respected members of the community, are accused.**

or

> Dozens of people in Salem are accused of witchcraft. **Notably,** Rebecca Nurse and John
> Proctor, highly respected members of the community, are accused.

### Mix It Up: Using Transitions from
### Different Categories

After students have become familiar with different categories of transitions,
you can have them choose from among several types. The following examples
show transitions from the time-and-sequence, illustration, and conclusion
categories.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Connect the following sentences using the given transition words.
>
> In addition For example
>
> Specifically As a result
>
> 1.  Augustus Caesar introduced many economic reforms. **In addition,** he focused
>     attention on political and social issues.
>
> 2.  The rule of Augustus improved the status of women. **Specifically,** women had
>     rights and could own property.
>
> 3.  Roman engineers made major changes within the Roman Empire. **For example,**
>     the engineers paved streets and designed sewage systems.
>
> 4.  Augustus Caesar’s reforms were a great success. **As a result,** Rome experienced
>     over 200 years of peace and prosperity.

<div align="left">96 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

If students have been reading *Jumanji,*¹⁵ you might give them the following
activity.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the second sentence following the transition word.
>
> 1.  Many scary things happened while Judy and Peter played *Jumanji*. Specifically,
>     **a lion tried to attack Peter.**
>
> 2.  *Jumanji* came with specific instructions. For example, **the first player to reach
>     the end must yell “Jumanji” to win and end the game.**
>
> 3.  Monkeys tore apart the kitchen. Then, **a monsoon came.**
>
> 4.  A rhinoceros stampede came through the living room. Also, **a python wrapped
>     itself around the fireplace.**

#### Differentiating Transition Activities

If some of your students need more support than others in using transitions,
you can give them a word bank of possible transitions—or tell them what
category of transition they need to supply and have them consult Appendix C,
“Transition Words and Phrases.”

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> You may find that your students fill in the blank after a transition word with a
> fragment rather than a complete sentence. If that happens, tell them to cover up
> the transition word and make sure that the rest of the sentence can stand alone.

## Appositives:
## Another Name for a Noun

> **WHY PRACTICE APPOSITIVE ACTIVITIES?**
>
> *   Provides the third strategy for creating topic and concluding
>     sentences
> *   Familiarizes students with a form that is often seen in text and rarely
>     heard in spoken language
> *   Enables students to vary sentence structure
> *   Enables students to add information and complexity to a sentence
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary
> *   Provides a check for comprehension
> *   Encourages careful reading

An **appositive** is a second noun, or a phrase or clause equivalent to a noun,
that is placed beside another noun to explain it more fully. For example:

> One World Trade Center, **the tallest building in New York City**, is also
> known as the Freedom Tower.

In this example, “the tallest building in New York City” is the appositive.

An appositive usually follows the noun it describes, as in the previous
example, but it can also precede it:

> **The tallest building in New York City**, One World Trade Center, is also
> known as the Freedom Tower.

Students may have trouble grasping the concept of appositives. They may
confuse them with **relative clauses**, which begin with *who, that, which, where,*
or *when*, and include a verb—a construction more likely to be found in
spoken language. For example:

> One World Trade Center, **which is the tallest building in New York City**, is
> also known as the Freedom Tower.

---
<!-- PAGE 128 -->
<div align="left">98 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

It may be helpful for your students to know that most appositives begin
with *a, an,* or *the*.

To help students identify the appositive in a sentence, tell them that it’s a
phrase that can be removed or covered up without making the entire sen tence incomplete. If we omitted the phrase “the tallest building in New York
City” in the first example about the World Trade Center, we would still have a
complete sentence:

> One World Trade Center is also known as the Freedom Tower.

Use your judgment about whether your students are ready to learn about
appositives. In our experience, they should not be introduced before the
middle of third grade or beginning of fourth grade.

Before teaching your students appositive activities, be sure to give them an
explanation of the purpose appositives serve. For example, you could say that
appositives:

*   always follow or come before a noun and help to describe it further;
*   further define or describe a person, place, or thing;
*   are set off by commas if they appear in the middle of a sentence; and
*   can help them create more effective topic and concluding sentences
    because they give the reader more information.

**Adding an appositive is the third strategy for creating topic and con cluding sentences (see Exhibit 4.4).**

**Exhibit 4.4 Three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences**

---
<!-- PAGE 129 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 99</div>

The most effective way to introduce students to appositives is the following
sequence:

1.  Identify appositives.
2.  Match appositives.
3.  Fill in appositives.
4.  Brainstorm appositives.
5.  Given an appositive,
    write a sentence.
6.  Given a topic, write a
    sentence with an appositive.

### 1. Identify Appositives

Give students examples of sentences containing appositives and have them
underline them. Remember that for these activities, an appositive should not
include a verb.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Underline the appositive in the sentence.
>
> Louis XIV, <u>an absolute monarch of France</u>, built the Palace of Versailles as a
> symbol of royal power.

### 2. Match Appositives

You can create a matching activity based on a text your class has been study ing. For example, if your class has been reading *Flowers for Algernon,*¹⁶ you
could list the major characters on the left side of the sheet and a noun phrase
that describes each of them on the other—not in the same order, of course.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Match each noun with the appositive that best describes it.
>
> 1.  **b** Alice Kinnian a. a white mouse
>
> 2.  **e** Dr. Strauss b. Charlie’s teacher
>
> 3.  **d** Burt Seldon c. a professor of psychology
>
> 4.  **a** Algernon d. a graduate student
>
> 5.  **c** Dr. Nemur e. a neurosurgeon

---
<!-- PAGE 130 -->
<div align="left">100 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### 3. Fill In Appositives

Next, you can have your students fill in blanks with appositives in sentences
that you create. For students who may not be able to insert an appositive
independently, a word bank will help them choose the appropriate one.

The following example assumes students have read *A Raisin in the Sun*.¹⁷

> **DIRECTIONS:** Use an appositive to complete each sentence.
>
> 1.  Beneatha thinks George Murchison, **a wealthy classmate**, is not marriage
>     material.
>
> 2.  Ruth, **Travis’s mother**, wants her son to be independent and responsible.
>
> 3.  Beneatha met Asagai, **a student from Nigeria**, on her college campus.
>
> 4.  Asagai brings Beneatha a gift, **robes from Nigeria**.

### 4. Brainstorm Appositives

Have students suggest appositives for a particular topic.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm appositives for the given topic.
>
> **TOPIC:** Marie Curie
>
> **a famous physicist**
>
> **winner of the Nobel Prize**
>
> **a renowned chemist**
>
> **a Polish scientist**
>
> **an inventor**
>
> **the scientist who discovered radium**

---
<!-- PAGE 131 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 101</div>

### 5. Given an Appositive, Write a Sentence

Given an appositive for a topic your class has been studying, have students
write a sentence incorporating that appositive.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a sentence using the given appositive.
>
> a Greek city-state
> **Athens, a Greek city-state, valued education and democracy.**
>
> a great philosopher
> **Socrates, a Greek philosopher, created a method of questioning.**
>
> a series of contests
> **The Olympics, a series of contests, were held in honor of the Greek gods.**

### 6. Given a Topic, Write a Sentence with an Appositive

> **DIRECTIONS:** For each topic, write a sentence using an appositive.
>
> natural selection
> **Natural selection, a process of evolution, results in species with favorable
> traits.**

## Out of Many, One:
## Sentence-Combining

> **WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-COMBINING?**
>
> *   Teaches grammar and usage
> *   Encourages students to produce more compound and complex sentences
> *   Enables students to see various options for crafting sentences
> *   Exposes students to varied writing structures and enhances syntactic
>     flexibility
> *   Improves fluency in writing

**Sentence-combining** involves giving students a series of short declarative
sentences and having them find various ways of combining those sentences into
one longer, compound or complex sentence. Extensive research has found it to be
a highly effective way of teaching grammar. It also gives students greater control
over **syntax**, which is the way words are put together and ordered in sentences.¹⁸

If you’ve taught your students how to use conjunctions, appositives, and sub ordinating conjunctions, they’ll be able to draw on those techniques in finding
ways to combine sentences. They’ll also be able to practice using pronouns.

To introduce students to sentence-combining, give them a series of short,
declarative sentences that can be combined into one longer, complex sentence.
Begin with just two or three sentences, adding more as students’ skills develop.

For example, you could give your students the following short sentences:

> Tania took the subway every day.
>
> Tania did not like the subway.
>
> Tania needed to get to work.

There are a variety of ways these sentences could be combined into one
longer sentence. You could, for example, put the second sentence first and
introduce it with a subordinating conjunction.

> Although Tania did not like the subway, she took it every day because
> she needed to get to work.

---
<!-- PAGE 133 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 103</div>

You could also begin with the second sentence and use basic conjunctions
to connect it to the other two.

> Tania didn’t like the subway, but she took it every day because she
> needed to get to work.

Once students feel comfortable with the concept of sentence-combining,
it’s time to start embedding the activity in the content you’re teaching.

#### Level 1 Example

This example assumes students have read *Fourth Grade Rats*.¹⁹

> **DIRECTIONS:** Combine the given sentences in one sentence.
>
> Joey stopped wearing tattoos.
>
> Joey stopped acting like a rat.
>
> **Joey stopped wearing tattoos and acting like a rat.**

#### Level 2 Example

If you’ve been teaching your students about two of the ancient civilizations of
India, you could give them the following sentences to combine:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Combine the given sentences in one sentence.
>
> Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were twin cities.
>
> Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa used urban planning.
>
> The cities had a system of plumbing.
>
> **Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were twin cities that used urban planning and
> had a system of plumbing.**

---
<!-- PAGE 134 -->
<div align="left">104 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Students may not need knowledge of the content to engage in sentence combining activities. In the preceding example, even if you’ve never heard
of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, you can create a complex sentence because
you’ve been given all the information you need in the simple sentences.

Since it doesn’t necessarily require students to retrieve information from
long-term memory, sentence-combining may not be as powerful in reinforc ing and deepening knowledge as some other TWR activities.

However, sentence-combining activities are still a good use of students’
time. In some cases, they will need to draw on their knowledge of the topic to
combine the simple sentences effectively, and they will always be reinforcing
their knowledge of grammar and syntax.

## Using Sentence Activities
## to Teach Grammar and
## Conventions

As TWR’s Principle 5 states, grammar is best taught in the context of student
writing. In fact, for many students, that’s probably the *only* way they’ll learn
to use the grammar and conventions of written English. And sentence activ ities are the most effective vehicle for teaching those skills. If you wait until
students are writing paragraphs and compositions, the number of mechanical
errors can be overwhelming for you and for your students.

Naturally, we don’t expect students to master all the conventions of written
English at once, but there’s no reason to hold off on gradually introducing the
fundamentals.

If you’re working with Level 1 students, you may need to start by teaching
them to begin each sentence with a capital letter and end it with a period.
As your students progress, you can introduce the use of question marks and
exclamation points. Once they have a grasp of those conventions, you can
begin to focus on the capitalization of proper nouns.

---
<!-- PAGE 135 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 105</div>

When introducing students to the first subordinating conjunctions they’ll
encounter—*before, after, if,* and *when*—show them that the comma should go
after the dependent clause. For example:

> After it stops raining, I’m going to take a walk.

In addition to giving students examples of sentences like these, you’ll also
need to ensure that they’re placing commas correctly in their own writing.

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> Be careful not to overload Level 1 students with grammatical terms. It can become
> confusing and overwhelming to try to learn these terms while they are also thinking
> about spelling, sentence structure, and word choice. They can practice applying
> correct grammar and conventions without necessarily learning their labels.
>
> TWR’s method does teach certain grammatical terms, such as *appositive*, that are
> useful as a kind of shorthand for concepts that are key parts of the method. If you
> want to suggest a specific way of varying sentence structure, it’s easier to say “Try
> adding an appositive” than “Try adding a phrase describing the noun.”
>
> But TWR doesn’t teach grammatical terms just for the sake of teaching them. For
> example, the method doesn’t require teaching the concept of a prepositional phrase,
> which is a construction students are likely to be using naturally.

## Weave It In:
## Integrating Sentence Activities
## into Daily Instruction

Given that the ability to craft a good sentence is the necessary foundation for all
good writing, it’s important to offer as many opportunities as possible for stu dents to practice writing sentences, even after they have progressed to writing
paragraphs and compositions. In addition, **sentence activities can be powerful
boosts to students’ understanding and retention of content.** If students have

---
<!-- PAGE 136 -->
<div align="left">106 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

already learned how to use appositives, for example, constructing them in the
context of new material will both provide a review of the grammatical concept
and help students understand and remember the new material.

Once you and your students have become acquainted with various
TWR sentence activities, you’ll find there are many ways to use them in
your classroom—no matter the grade level or the subject you’re teaching.
A few possibilities are outlined here.

At the beginning of class, you can give students a do-now to review mate rial you’ve taught previously.

> Although Egyptians built the pyramids, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mid-lesson, you may want to pause and have students do a **stop-and-jot**
by asking them to develop a question about what they’ve learned so far.

You could also have students **turn-and-talk** to complete a *because-but-so*
activity.

> Egyptians built pyramids because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Egyptians built pyramids, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Egyptians built pyramids, so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At the end of class, consider having students fill in an exit slip responding
to highlights in the lesson.

> Egyptians built pyramids. As a result, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As a quiz, you can ask students to complete the following activities:

> Write a sentence using this appositive: *huge monuments in the
> Egyptian desert*.

or

> Write a sentence with an appositive about the topic of *Egyptian pyramids*.

<div align="right">Chapter 4 | Sentences: Introducing Variety and Complexity 107</div>

If you weave these kinds of sentence-level activities into your instruction
on a daily basis, you’ll be giving your students the tools they need to create
effective paragraphs and compositions, while at the same time boosting their
understanding of the content you’re teaching.

### CHAPTER 5
# Planning before
# Writing
## Determining the Shape of What’s to Come

> Ms. Allen, a seventh-grade ELA teacher, noticed that whenever she asked her
> students to produce a written response to a prompt, certain things were bound to
> happen.
>
> Some students just put their heads down on their desks, seeming to give up before
> they had even started.
>
> Others would start scribbling industriously, raising Ms. Allen’s hopes. But when she
> collected their papers, she was usually disappointed to find pages of disorganized
> thoughts, often barely understandable.
>
> And then there was Tyler. Normally good-humored and likable, Tyler seemed to
> undergo a personality transformation when he was asked to write. He would leave
> his seat and start poking other students, disrupting the entire class and ignoring
> Ms. Allen’s requests that he sit down. At times, he would simply take an extended
> bathroom break, returning only after the time allotted for the writing assignment
> was over.
>
> Eventually, Ms. Allen realized that Tyler wasn’t just misbehaving. He was desperate to
> avoid revealing his inability to write. The students who put their heads down on their
> desks were less disruptive, but they felt the same way. And the others who produced
> pages of unintelligible prose? They didn’t even realize they weren’t able to write
> coherently.

---
<!-- PAGE 144 -->
<div align="left">114 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

> Ms. Allen wondered how students could get to seventh grade without knowing how
> to write a paragraph, let alone an essay. Everyone expected them to have already
> acquired those skills. If they hadn’t, they felt they were failures—and for some kids,
> like Tyler, that painful feeling led them to act out.

Students like those in Ms. Allen’s classroom *can* learn to write effective para graphs and essays if they’re taught how to plan carefully first.

If you’re about to embark on a road trip, try a new recipe, develop a
football play—or engage in just about any complex, multi-step task—you
need to have a plan. Without one, it is far more likely that your efforts will
be disappointing at best and end in failure at worst. Yet, when we teach our
students to write in lengthier forms such as paragraphs and compositions, we
don’t often help them come up with the kind of plan they need to produce an
effective piece of writing.

Some people say that planning will constrain students’ creativity. To the
contrary, we’ve found that teaching students to plan can actually *enhance*
their creativity. If students are working from a plan, they’re liberated from
the need to figure out the overall structure of what they’re writing as they go
along. As a result, they have the mental space they need to conjure up vivid
imagery or relevant details.

True, some authors prefer to simply free-write as a first step in their
writing process, allowing their thoughts to take them where they will. But
that approach doesn’t work for most students, for at least two reasons. First,
most students are not experienced writers. They may still be struggling with
figuring out everything from punctuation or word choice to larger questions
such as the overall organization of their thoughts. If they’re asked to plunge
into a longer piece of writing with no outline to follow, they’ll need to juggle
all these tasks at once. As we explained in Chapter 1, they’re likely to be
overwhelmed.

Second, the free-writing approach to drafting is best suited to relatively
free-form genres such as memoirs, poems, plays, short stories, or (perhaps)
novels. That’s not the kind of writing most of us are expected to produce in
college or the workplace. What we are asked to do, in countless situations, is
to explain, inform, justify, enumerate, summarize, and describe. (A compre hensive list of these expository writing terms can be found in Appendix A.)

<!-- PAGE 145 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 5 | Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What’s to Come 115</div>

Even many experienced writers find planning to be essential if they’re
going to communicate effectively. As compared to more creative forms
of writing, explanatory, argumentative, and analytical pieces demand that
authors figure out in advance where they’re going to end up and chart a clear
and logical course that will lead a reader there.

As a classic writing handbook points out, “planning must be a deliberate
prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee
or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.”¹

In short, if you want your students to be able to move from writing effective
sentences to writing coherent paragraphs—and, ultimately, compositions—
you’ll need to teach them how to plan before they write, using the linear out lines that we present in Chapters 6 and 9. As with revising—which we’ll turn
to in Chapter 7—planning/outlining is a stage of writing that rarely receives
enough instructional time and attention.

## Offloading the Cognitive Burden:
## Why Planning Is Crucial

Why is it so important for students to plan before they write? Largely because
of the demands that writing places on **executive functions**, which are
cognitive processes that enable us to plan, monitor, and successfully achieve
our goals. They are housed primarily in the prefrontal cortex of the brain and
enable us to perform a series of actions that are essential to good writing. The
abilities associated with executive functions begin to develop in early child hood, but they don’t reach their peak until we are in our mid-20s. That means
that virtually all students in kindergarten through twelfth grade are working
with executive function abilities that are still a work in progress.

When assigning writing tasks, teachers need to be keenly aware of the
demands they place on a student’s executive functions, including working
memory. These functions enable a writer to do the following tasks:

*   **Strategize.** For beginning or less experienced writers, the teacher, not
    the student, selects the topic. Selecting a topic demands the ability to
    foresee consequences. A topic shouldn’t be so narrow that there is too

---
<!-- PAGE 146 -->
<div align="left">116 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

    little material to write about. If the topic is too broad, a great deal of
    skill is needed to sort essential from non-essential information.
*   **Initiate a series of actions.** After a topic is selected, students need to
    find textual evidence to support a topic sentence or thesis statement.
*   **Outline.** Students must be able to develop an outline that provides a
    road map for presenting a body of information, an explanation, or an
    argument. When students plan by creating an outline, they will have
    more cognitive resources to devote to tasks like self-monitoring and
    instituting needed changes.
*   **Organize.** Students need to sequence information in the outline
    in the order that suits a particular piece of writing, whether it’s a
    narrative, an argument, or a comparison of two or more different
    things.
*   **Resist distractions.** The typical classroom and home are full of
    potential distractions, and the modern era—with its screens and
    ubiquitous internet connections—seems to have made students’
    attention spans shorter than ever.
*   **Sustain effort.** Students must maintain the stamina necessary to focus
    on the writing task at hand.
*   **Self-monitor.** When working on a draft, students need to continually
    assess it to ensure they’re not going off track. They must be able to
    identify non-essential, less essential, and essential information.
*   **Institute needed changes.** Although students can make changes while
    creating an outline, most often they will do so while writing or revising
    a draft. Changes can range from reorganizing an entire sequence
    of ideas to executing smaller modifications such as choosing more
    accurate words, varying sentence structure, and inserting transitions.

A key component of executive functioning is working memory, the aspect
of our consciousness where we try to make sense of new information. As we
discussed in Chapter 2, writing places a heavy burden on working memory—
a burden that scientists call cognitive load. Depending on the topic, even
constructing sentences can impose a heavy cognitive load on inexperienced
writers. Writing at length only increases that load, and it can impose a

---
<!-- PAGE 147 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 5 | Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What’s to Come 117</div>

significant burden even if students have good sentence-level skills. Yet stu dents who are still struggling with the basics of writing, at all grade levels, are
frequently asked to compose not only paragraphs but entire essays.

Teachers need to be aware that executive functions are compromised by
attention deficit disorders and stress. Stress can be caused by many factors,
and nearly all students experience it to some extent. Those who are most
likely to experience the levels of stress that interfere with executive functions
include students who have language and learning disabilities, those who are
still learning English, and those who live in chronically stressful conditions,
such as those associated with poverty. Students who are under a great
deal of pressure to succeed or who have suffered loss also can experience
significant stress.

However, writing—and especially composing lengthy writing assignments—
is such a complex activity that virtually *all* students will experience some level
of stress while engaging in it. That’s why it’s particularly important for them
to have a clear, written plan before they begin writing at length. Such a plan
enables writers to “offload” some of the burden that writing at length imposes
on working memory.²

## Identifying Topic, Audience,
## and Purpose

To plan a paragraph or a composition, your students need to understand
three things: the topic they’re writing about, the readers they’re trying to
communicate with, and the reason they’re writing. Initially, you’ll need to

---
<!-- PAGE 148 -->
<div align="left">118 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

lead them in class discussions since most students will find it difficult to
identify these elements on their own.

### Choosing a Topic

It’s best to choose a topic that is part of the core curriculum and that students
have already learned something about.

Sometimes students are expected to follow a separate writing curriculum
that provides little information about the topics they’re supposed to write
about. However, it’s virtually impossible to write about a topic you know little
or nothing about.

Students are also often asked to write about their personal experiences or
opinions—for example, an essay on whether the cafeteria should serve choc olate milk. While students may have the knowledge to engage in that kind of
writing, they miss out on the opportunity to use writing to build and deepen
their knowledge.

Even when choosing topics from the core curriculum, it’s crucial to deter mine if students have enough background knowledge about the topic before
they begin the planning process. If students need more information, class
discussions should help them acquire it or help them identify the best sources
to provide it. Students need *some* knowledge to begin planning a piece of
writing, but in the process, they may identify gaps in their knowledge and
they may take the opportunity to fill those gaps.

### Determining the Audience

One of the more challenging aspects of writing for many students is to
imagine themselves in the mind of an intended reader. They may struggle
to anticipate what that reader would need or want to know and modify their
writing accordingly. For example, a paragraph describing Washington, DC,
that’s directed at an audience of first-time tourists will be very different from
one aimed at people who already live or work there.

Of course, in the context of the classroom, the audience is primarily you,
the teacher—and ideally, you’ll know at least as much about the topic as your
students. But students need to be reminded that in some situations they’ll

---
<!-- PAGE 149 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 5 | Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What’s to Come 119</div>

need to tailor the structure, facts, word choice, and arguments in their writing
to the kinds of readers they’re planning to reach. Even though their teacher
may know a lot about the topic, it’s important for students to learn how to
write for other audiences who don’t.

For example, older students can imagine they’re writing about a topic
relating to climate change for an audience of third graders. Then have them
imagine writing about the same topic for an audience of climate-change
skeptics. Would they choose different language? Would they need to explain
more information for one group as opposed to another? Would they make
different points?

The intended audience will also determine the tone a writer adopts. Your
tone is likely to be different if you’re addressing someone you know well as
opposed to someone else. On the left in Exhibit 5.1 is an example of a note
that I wrote to my husband while dashing out the door, and the example on
the right is a note that I wrote to a friend who was staying with us.

<!-- Placeholder for Exhibit 5.1 Image -->
<!-- Exhibit 5.1 shows two notepad images.
Left notepad: Large, handwritten "GET MILK"
Right notepad: Handwritten note: "Hi Christine, I had to rush out to a meeting. If you don't mind, would you please pick up some bread for us? I'll be back soon. Thank you! xo Judy" -->
**Exhibit 5.1**

In most cases, students should adopt a fairly formal tone in their writing
assignments since that’s the tone they’ll usually be expected to take in college
and in the workplace.

---
<!-- PAGE 150 -->
<div align="left">120 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Writing prompts and test questions may not specify the audience students
should have in mind. In that case, students should generally assume that the
reader is someone without a great deal of specific information about the topic.

Sometimes the prompts themselves will define how much information
students need to provide. If a prompt reads “Summarize the plot of *Animal
Farm*,” students will need to relate the key points of the entire plot as if the
audience knows nothing about it. If, on the other hand, a prompt reads
“Analyze Squealer’s role on the farm,” students should focus only on that
aspect of the novel.

### Understanding the Purpose

Are students trying to persuade the reader to adopt a certain position, or
are they simply narrating a series of events? The purpose of a piece of
writing influences many of the choices students will make in planning it. A
paragraph that is intended to persuade a reader usually has a different kind
of topic sentence than one that is describing a situation, place, or person.
Similarly, the concluding sentence of a persuasive piece of writing might be a
call to action rather than a summary of what’s been said.

Writers will also organize details differently depending on their purpose.
If they’re writing about a series of events or a process, it will make sense to
narrate them in chronological order. But if they’re trying to persuade a reader
to adopt a particular point of view, they will probably want to begin with their
“soft” arguments and end with their strongest.

The language you use when creating a writing prompt or posing a question
for students can signal the particular purpose of the writing you’re looking
for, so acquaint your students with the various expository terms and their
meanings (see Appendix A). For example, if you ask them to *justify* some thing, this means the purpose of their writing is argumentative. If you’re
teaching Level 2 students, you might use some of the following expository
terms to help students identify the purpose of a writing assignment:

> **Contrast** the candidate’s positions with those of his opponent.
>
> **Summarize** the plot of *The Scarlet Letter*.
>
> **Discuss** the symbolism in the setting of *Lord of the Flies*.
>
> **Analyze** the relationship between Finny and Gene in *A Separate Peace*.

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Expository
> Writing Terms
> *Appendix A*

Even younger Level 1 students can practice responding to some of the
expository terms. For example:

> **Explain** why Mr. Falker was a good teacher.
>
> **Discuss** why the disappearance of sea ice is affecting penguins.
>
> **Describe** the garden where Mary meets Ben.
>
> **Summarize** Chapter 2.

## A Guide to Purpose:
## Three Types of Writing

Identifying the purpose of a piece of writing determines much of the tone
and organization of the paragraph or composition.

To help students identify purpose in writing, TWR emphasizes three
types of paragraphs and compositions: **expository, narrative,** and **opinion**
or **argumentative**. In the real world, of course, a single piece of writing often
contains more than one of these types at a time. But when students are first
learning to write at length, they need practice with one type of writing at a
time. Later, when they’ve become comfortable with the demands of each type,
they can begin to blend them in the way experienced writers often do.

### Expository Writing

Classes in English, social studies, and science tend to generate assignments
that require expository writing. Therefore, most of the time spent on writing
instruction should be devoted to teaching students how to do it well.

Expository writing may explore:

*   presenting a problem and a solution
*   analyzing a cause-and-effect relationship
*   providing a description or giving directions
*   comparing and contrasting two concepts, events, or individuals and
    drawing a conclusion based on the facts presented

---
<!-- PAGE 152 -->
<div align="left">122 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

When introducing compare-and-contrast assignments, be aware that orga nizing those kinds of essays can challenge the skills of many writers. It can be
even more difficult to write a single paragraph interweaving two points of view.

### Narrative Writing

Narrative writing relates a process, a biography, or event in chronological or
sequential order, and is usually organized with transition words that signal
time or sequence, such as *first, next, then, later,* and *finally* (see Appendix C,
“Transition Words and Phrases”). In general, narratives are written in either
the first person (as a participant) or third person (as an observer).

Narrative writing involving fictional stories or personal experience is not
the focus of the Hochman Method. Rather, the kind of narratives we cover
might include summarizing a plot in English class, explaining the steps for
solving a problem in math, tracing a process in science, enumerating the
important milestones in a biography, or identifying what led up to a historic
event in social studies.

### Opinion Writing and
### Argumentative Writing

We discuss opinion writing and argumentative writing in detail in Chapter 10,
but we’ll provide a brief overview of these types of writing here. Opinion
writing, usually assigned to elementary students, seeks to change how the
reader thinks or feels without providing evidence or opposing views. By con trast, argumentative writing presents both sides of an issue, appeals to logic,
and gathers evidence and reasons for supporting one side or the other. The
conclusion usually proposes the action or point of view that the writer would
like the reader to take.

Education experts consider argumentative writing the most complex and
cognitively demanding form of composition.³ As they become more experi enced writers, students may be required to support their claims with evidence
and weigh the pros and cons of each side. Perhaps most challenging, they must
be able to accurately represent a position with which they may not agree, then
take an opposing position and justify it to the reader.

> Transition Words
> and Phrases
> *Appendix C*

---
<!-- PAGE 153 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 5 | Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What’s to Come 123</div>

Most argumentative assignments are given in middle and high schools.
Students might be asked to criticize an author’s technique or to evaluate the
importance of a historical event. But most state writing standards call for
students to begin writing “opinion pieces” in the early elementary grades, so
it’s a good idea to begin instruction in this kind of writing earlier than middle
school.

However, it may be more difficult to find opinion and argumentative
assignments for young children that are embedded in the content of the
curriculum. If necessary, you might have to assign opinion pieces on non curricular topics such as “Homework on Weekends.” But if a school is using
an elementary curriculum that is rich in content—and especially, in historical
topics—it may well be possible to have students engage in curriculum-based
opinion writing.

Before your students begin to write an outline for an opinion or argu mentative paragraph or composition, have them engage in class discussions
about their topic. That kind of dialogue or debate can help them determine
and refine their own opinions and formulate arguments that their intended
audience would find persuasive.

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   Writing at length places heavy demands on the aspects of cognition known as
>     executive functions and working memory.
> *   Before students can plan a piece of writing, they need to identify the topic, the
>     audience, and the purpose.
> *   Encourage students to write for different audiences, possibly requiring them

<!-- PAGE 156 -->
<div align="left">126 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Graphic organizers such as thought webs, Venn diagrams, and bubble maps
may be helpful for brainstorming, vocabulary instruction, or helping students
grasp certain concepts. However, they don’t provide an effective template
for transferring those ideas into a coherent piece of writing. A crucial step is
missing: taking the material in the bubbles, webs, or boxes and figuring out
what is most important, what is least important or irrelevant, and how to put
the ideas and points in a logical order.

Some teachers may have tried the Harvard Outline, with its main ideas,
sub-ideas, sub-sub-ideas, Roman numerals, and capital and lowercase letters.
Although it has the advantage of a linear structure, and it can serve as a great
study guide, we’ve found that the Harvard Outline doesn’t translate well into
paragraphs or essays. It goes to the other extreme from the free-form bubble
map, requiring such high-level categorization and classification skills that
students can get bogged down and confused in the planning process. Even if
they do manage to complete such a detailed outline, they may find it difficult
to convert the complex structure to written text.

What Ms. Chen didn’t realize was that before asking her students to write,
she needed to help them through the process of constructing a simple outline.
If she had, she might have found that her students’ paragraphs were far clearer
and more coherent.

Teachers may feel pressure to have students write multiple-paragraph com positions, especially at higher grade levels. But teaching students to outline
and write a single coherent paragraph first is a crucial investment of time
and energy. In one study done with seventh and eighth graders, students who
used TWR’s Single-Paragraph Outline achieved better results than those who
used a concept map or no planning tool at all—and the students who got the
highest writing scores not only used the outline but also had been explicitly
taught how to use it. Students also preferred the outline. Of those who used it,
85 percent said it made writing a paragraph easier.¹

Learning to use certain text structures in the context of a single
paragraph—such as problem/solution or cause/effect—will help equip

---
<!-- PAGE 157 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 127</div>

students to plan and write essays using those structures later on. And once
students are familiar with TWR outlines, they can easily replicate them on
scratch paper when asked to provide written responses on tests, or when
planning essays and compositions independently.

**Remember that students should continue to practice sentence-level
strategies while learning to outline and draft paragraphs. You also don’t
have to wait for students to “master” sentence-level strategies before
introducing them to the Single-Paragraph Outline. These activities can
and should be done in tandem.**

## Defining Terms

A **paragraph** is a group of sentences that includes details supporting
a specific point. A well-written paragraph will display the following
characteristics:²

*   **Structure.** The sentences in the paragraph are sequenced in a way
    that ensures clarity for the reader.
*   **Coherence.** The sentences are logically connected with transition
    words that signal that connection, including indications of a change
    of direction or emphasis.
*   **Unity.** Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph.
*   **Well-constructed sentences.** The sentences are grammatically correct
    and clear, and their types and structures vary (some simple, others
    compound or complex).

The simple linear format of the SPO benefits all students.

Solid lines tell students to write complete sentences for the **topic sentence**
(T.S.) and the **concluding sentence** (C.S.). Dotted lines tell students to write
notes for supporting details.

Exhibit 6.2 is an example of an SPO a student has completed—and after
that, the paragraph the student might write based on it.

This chapter provides you with strategies and activities to use when guid ing your students to eventually create outlines and paragraphs on their own.

## SPO Scaffolding Activities

The ultimate objective is to enable students to produce an outline inde pendently. However, handing them a blank SPO without first teaching
them the necessary underlying skills won’t produce that outcome.

Before students can construct an SPO on their own, they will need to learn
the steps leading up to that task: creating a topic sentence, including and
sequencing relevant details, and crafting a concluding sentence.

A **topic sentence** expresses a paragraph’s main idea. Make sure students
understand that the sentences in the body of a paragraph should provide
details that relate to the general idea contained in the topic sentence.

**When you’re modeling using notes for detail sentences, remember not
to write full sentences on the dotted lines.** Usually, when Level 1 students
are ready to create SPOs independently, they should also use only key words
and phrases for notes, but more experienced writers can add symbols and
abbreviations (see Appendix B).

When writing in note form on the detail lines, tell students that the notes
don’t necessarily indicate just one sentence. Specifically, an example or a
quotation included on the same dotted line could be written as more than
one sentence in the paragraph.

A **concluding sentence** may restate the main idea of the paragraph,
although it shouldn’t just be a repetition of the topic sentence.
Alternatively, depending on the type of paragraph, a concluding sentence
might express a point of view or a call to action.

Developing topic and concluding sentences requires students to consider
a collection of facts and information and decide what characteristics unite
them—in other words, to develop the ability to make generalizations. Many
of the activities that follow will help students in identifying and creating both
topic and concluding sentences. Once students have created an effective topic
sentence, constructing the concluding sentence is often an easier job.

**Sequence of SPO Scaffolding Activites:**

1.  Create an SPO with the whole class.
2.  Distinguish a T.S. from details.
3.  Identify T.S. and sequence details.
4.  Given T.S., select relevant details from a list.
5.  Eliminate irrelevant detail(s) from a list or SPO.
6.  Given T.S., generate details.
7.  Practice the three strategies for writing a T.S. and C.S.
8.  Given topic/prompt, generate T.S.
9.  Given details, generate T.S.
10. Given T.S. and details, generate C.S.
11. Given topic/prompt, construct SPO independently.

### 1. Create an SPO with the Whole Class

You should have your students practice the steps involved in creating an SPO
before asking them to develop one themselves, but it’s helpful to demonstrate
the entire process first so they know where they’re headed. When modeling
the SPO for Level 1 students, consider selecting topics that are not compli cated or don’t require searching for new information.

Level 2 students can begin learning how to construct SPOs based on a
current curriculum topic if most students in the class have already acquired
enough information about it to help generate topic and concluding sentences
and details.

---
<!-- PAGE 162 -->
<div align="left">132 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

There are two ways to develop an SPO with the whole class. One, as
shown in the following example, is to have students come up with a topic
sentence and then narrate a series of details related to it, perhaps in chrono logical order.

#### Level 1 Narrative Example

> T.S. **Try growing bean plants at home.**
>
> first 1. **holes in bottom of container**
>
> next 2. **put soil in and dig holes**
>
> then 3. **put seeds in and cover**
>
> finally 4. **water every day**
>
> C.S. **It is exciting to watch seeds grow into plants!**

> Try growing bean plants at home. First, you should put holes in the
> bottom of a container. Next, put soil in it and dig holes. Then, you
> put seeds in the holes and cover them with soil. Finally, be sure to
> water your plants every day. It is exciting to watch your seeds grow
> into plants!

<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 133</div>

#### Level 2 Narrative Example

> T.S. **It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid.**
>
> first 1. **clean container**
>
> next 2. **fill w/ few in. of liquid**
>
> then 3. **dip test strip/few sec.**
>
> finally 4. **compare color/litmus scale**
>
> C.S. **If you follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is
> acidic, neutral, or alkaline.**

> It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid. First, thoroughly clean
> the container you are using. Next, fill the container with a few inches of
> the liquid you are testing. Then, dip the test strip in the liquid for a few
> seconds. Finally, compare the color you see to the litmus scale. If you
> follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is acidic, neutral,
> or alkaline.

<!-- PAGE 164 -->
<div align="left">134 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

The second way to develop an SPO involves brainstorming. The steps that
you would take are:

1.  Identify a topic, audience, and purpose.
2.  Help students brainstorm 10–15 details about a topic and organize
    them into categories.
3.  Generate a topic sentence on the solid line on the top of the outline
    using one of the three TWR strategies (sentence types, subordinating
    conjunctions, appositives).\* **This can be done before the brainstorming
    if preferred.**
4.  Select, categorize, and sequence details and write them in note form
    on the dotted lines. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion of TWR note taking techniques.) *Note that every brainstormed item does not have to
    be included on the SPO.*
5.  Generate a concluding sentence using one of the three TWR
    strategies (sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives)
    on the solid line at the bottom of the outline.\*\*

\*Level 2 students can use all three: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions,
and appositives. Level 1 students should begin with sentence types and then
three of the subordinating conjunctions: *before, after, if*.

\*\*A concluding transition may be appropriate to use at the beginning of the
concluding sentence.

#### Level 1 Brainstorming Example

> **TOPIC:** Winter
>
> soup cold + icy sweaters
>
> New Year’s Eve coats and scarves ice-skate, ski, sled
>
> hot chocolate holiday foods lip balm
>
> cozy blankets boots make a snowman
>
> hats + gloves cloudy snowy
>
> T.S. **Winter is a unique time of year.**
>
> 1.  **cold, snowy, cloudy days**
>
> 2.  **coats, sweaters, hats, gloves**
>
> 3.  **hot chocolate, soup, holiday foods**
>
> 4.  **skiing, sledding, making a snowman**
>
> C.S. **Clearly, winter is an exciting season!**

---
<!-- PAGE 166 -->
<div align="left">136 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 2 Brainstorming Example

> **TOPIC:** Achievements of Aztecs
>
> herbal treatments → cure diseases
>
> 1st. civ/dev edu syst → all children attended
>
> adv. calendar → improved farming
>
> adv. math syst → used area for construction
>
> built pyramids/temples for ceremonies
>
> built chinampas = floating gardens → crops ↑
>
> T.S. **The Aztecs, a Mesoamerican civilization, had many outstanding
> achievements.**
>
> 1.  **adv. math system → used area for construction**
>
> 2.  **1st civ./dev edu system → all children attended**
>
> 3.  **built pyramids/temples for ceremonies**
>
> 4.  **built chinampas = floating gardens → crops ↑**
>
> C.S. **The contributions of the Aztecs had a great impact on subsequent
> civilizations.**

Now that students have an idea of what the end product looks like, it’s time
to introduce them to the steps involved in creating an SPO. Each step has
value in itself and will help students think more analytically, find important
points more efficiently, and take notes more effectively. In addition, each step
requires modeling by the teacher, as well as oral and collaborative practice,
before students can engage in it independently.

Once students have learned these steps, they not only will be ready to
construct an SPO independently but also will have most of the skills they’ll
need when they move on to planning compositions.

<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 137</div>

### 2. Distinguish a T.S. from Details

To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence, present them
with three or more sentences and ask them to identify the topic sentence and
the sentence or sentences that provide supporting details. You could start
with three sentences and ask students to mark one with *T.S.* for *topic sentence*
and the other two with *D* for *detail*.

This example assumes that the students have read *Miss Nelson Is Missing!*³

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S.* and the supporting details
> using *D*.
>
> **D** Students had to do lots of homework.
>
> **T.S.** Ms. Swamp was a very strict teacher.
>
> **D** She cancelled story hour.

The next example is embedded in content relating to medieval Europe.

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S.* and the supporting details
> using *D*.
>
> **D** Art and literature began to reflect the times by including themes of death.
>
> **D** Many landowners were ruined financially due to a lack of laborers to
> cultivate the land.
>
> **T.S.** The Bubonic Plague, a dreadful disease, had a significant impact in
> Europe.
>
> **D** One third of Europe’s population, 25 million people, died.
>
> **D** Since many laborers died, many families lost their means of survival.

<div align="left">138 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### 3. Identify T.S. and Sequence Details

You can increase the level of difficulty by giving students groups of three to
five sentences and asking them to first identify the topic sentence and then
put the remaining sentences in a logical sequence. This activity will help
them understand how to sequence ideas or events within a paragraph.

In this activity, the transition words signal the sequence of the detail sentences.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S.* and number the supporting
> details in the correct order.
>
> **2** Then, the seed sprouts a plant with flowers.
>
> **T.S.** The growth of a pumpkin is interesting.
>
> **3** Finally, the flowers disappear, and the pumpkin grows!
>
> **1** First, a seed is planted in the ground.

Students who have been studying the Mughal Empire might complete the
following activity.

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S.* and number the supporting
> details in the correct order.
>
> **1** Babur started the empire and removed the Delhi Sultanate.
>
> **3** Jahangir continued the policy of tolerance toward Hindus along with most
> of Akbar’s policies.
>
> **2** After Babur, Akbar, the greatest Mughal Emperor, laid the foundation for
> many future leaders.
>
> **T.S.** There were many rulers of the Mughal Empire.
>
> **4** Shah Jahan also continued Akbar’s policies and built the Taj Mahal.

### 4. Given T.S., Select Relevant Details from a List

Provide students with two different topic sentences and a list of details. Have
students write each detail under the topic sentence it belongs with.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence.
>
> long lines play games buy souvenirs
>
> lots of walking overcrowded water rides
>
> T.S. Amusement parks are exciting.
>
> 1.  **play games**
>
> 2.  **buy souvenirs**
>
> 3.  **water rides**
>
> T.S. Amusement parks are exhausting.
>
> 1.  **long lines**
>
> 2.  **lots of walking**
>
> 3.  **overcrowded**

### 5. Eliminate Irrelevant Detail(s) from a List or SPO

Some students have difficulty distinguishing relevant from irrelevant details
or go off topic when they write. If some of your students fall into that cate gory, have them underline or put *T.S.* next to the topic sentence in a list and
then cross out the detail that has the least connection to the topic sentence.

This example assumes that the students have read *The Snowy Day*.⁴

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail.
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ He made a snowman.
>
> **T.S.** Peter had a wonderful time on a snowy day.
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Peter had a dream that the snow melted.</span>
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ He made snow angels.

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail.
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ Then, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation.
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ <span style="text-decoration:line-through">There is only one variable in the equation.</span>
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x.
>
> **T.S.** Follow 3 steps to solve 3(x+5) = 45.
>
> \_\_\_\_\_ Distribute the 3 inside the parentheses to get 3x + 15 = 45.

### 6. Given T.S., Generate Details

In this activity, you provide students with a topic sentence that you’ve cre ated on a blank SPO template and have them generate three or four details
to go with it.

For a Level 1 group, you might start with the following sentence.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic
> sentence.
>
> T.S. Dogs are popular pets.
>
> 1.  **protective**
>
> 2.  **loyal**
>
> 3.  **playful**

If you’ve been teaching Level 2 students about the Incan Empire, you could
give them the following sentence.

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence.
>
> T.S. Although the Incan Empire was in power for less than one hundred years, parts
> of its culture lives on today.
>
> 1.  **Quechuan language**
>
> 2.  **celebrate winter solstice**
>
> 3.  **textile making**
>
> 4.  **irrigation + architecture**

### 7. Practice the Three Strategies for
### Writing a T.S. and C.S.

When students were doing sentence-level work, they learned strategies to
help them create topic sentences. When first explaining how to use these
strategies for topic sentences, you should provide the topic and make sure
it’s one that students are familiar with.

If you are guiding Level 2 students through the formulation of topic sen tences, tell them about all three strategies (see Exhibit 6.3). If you’re teaching
Level 1 students, just discuss the first two—sentence types and subordinating
conjunctions—and limit the latter to the conjunctions *before, after,* and *if*.

<!-- Image of Exhibit 6.3 (Same as Exhibit 4.4) -->
<!-- Diagram shows a large number 3.
Arrow pointing up-right from 3 to "Sentence Types".
Arrow pointing right from 3 to "Subordinating Conjunctions".
Arrow pointing down-right from 3 to "Appositives".
-->
**Exhibit 6.3 Three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences**

*   **Use a sentence type.**
    Students may use a statement, a question, an exclamation, or (possibly)
    a command. For example, the topic sentence for a paragraph about
    Washington, DC might be, *Have you ever been to Washington, DC?*
    Note that while exclamations and commands can be helpful for
    younger students who are learning to write paragraphs, middle and
    high school students should generally not use them for topic sentences.
*   **Begin with a subordinating conjunction.**
    A Level 1 student might use a subordinating conjunction such as
    *before* to form a topic sentence. For example: *Before you get a dog,
    you need to make preparations.* A Level 2 student might use a more

---
<!-- PAGE 174 -->
<div align="left">144 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

    sophisticated conjunction such as *although*—as in *Although the New
    Deal did not solve all of the nation’s problems, it saved the United States
    from economic collapse.*
*   **Include an appositive.**
    A paragraph about New York City could start with *New York, the
    nation’s largest city, is visited by many tourists.* A paragraph about
    Genghis Khan might begin *Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader,
    created a large empire.*

Have your students practice using these strategies to transform boring
topic sentences into engaging, informative ones.

These three strategies are also useful in formulating concluding sentences—
which we’ll address further on in this chapter.

### 8. Given a Topic/Prompt, Generate T.S.

After students have had practice writing topic sentences using the three
strategies, give them a topic and ask them to create two or three topic sen tences for it. Level 1 students are expected to write topic sentences using only
sentence types and the subordinating conjunctions *before, after,* and *if*.

If students have been studying endangered species, you might give them
the following activity.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write two topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence type
> and one starting with a subordinating conjunction.
>
> **TOPIC:** Endangered sea turtles
>
> Sentence Type
> **Why are sea turtles endangered?**
>
> Subordinating Conjunction
> **Since sea turtles are endangered, steps must be taken to protect them.**

---
<!-- PAGE 175 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 145</div>

#### Level 2 Example

If your Level 2 students have been studying the environment, you might give
them the topic *climate change* and ask them to write three topic sentences
using each of the three strategies: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions,
and appositives. They might come up with the following sentences.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write three topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence
> type, one starting with a subordinating conjunction, and one including an appositive.
>
> **TOPIC:** Climate change
>
> Sentence Type
> **What is the leading cause of climate change?**
>
> Subordinating Conjunction
> **Since climate change has rapidly worsened weather extremes, steps must
> be taken to reverse it.**
>
> Appositive
> **Climate change, a deviation from usual weather or temperature, has
> become an urgent problem.**

### 9. Given Details, Generate T.S.

Provide students with an SPO without topic sentence. The details should be
presented in note form. Notes for Level 2 students should include key words
and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols, while notes for Level 1 students
should use just key words and phrases. This activity will require students to
synthesize a number of details to come up with a topic sentence that brings
them all together.

---
<!-- PAGE 176 -->
<div align="left">146 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 1 Example

If Level 1 students have been learning about the life cycle of a butterfly, you
could give them an SPO such as the following one and have them provide a
topic sentence.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details.
>
> T.S. **Penguins are endangered.**
>
> 1.  **Emperors + Adélies dropped by 1/2 since 1980s**
>
> 2.  **Antarctic sea ice not forming in winter**
>
> 3.  **krill disappearing/need sea ice**

Students might use the details shown in the following example—and the
knowledge that enables them to identify the era being discussed—to generate
a topic sentence.

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details.
>
> T.S. **The Mayans were a complex Mesoamerican civilization.**
>
> 1.  **present-day Mexico/Yucatan Peninsula**
>
> 2.  **polytheistic/sun + moon + rain gods**
>
> 3.  **accurate calendar + math + pyramids**
>
> 4.  **possible drought + famine/disease**

<!-- PAGE 177 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 147</div>

### 10. Given T.S. and Details, Generate C.S.

The same basic techniques that have enabled students to craft effective topic
sentences will work for concluding sentences—with one twist. A concluding
sentence should echo the idea of the topic sentence but not repeat it verbatim.

In some types of writing, the concluding sentence should introduce
something new—perhaps a call to action or a personal opinion. However, in
many cases, a paraphrase or summary of the topic sentence can serve as the
concluding one. Consider the following examples.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and details.
>
> T.S. What makes summer a special season?
>
> 1.  **warm weather**
>
> 2.  **shorts and T-shirts**
>
> 3.  **watermelon and ice cream cones**
>
> 4.  **baseball, fishing, swimming**
>
> C.S. **In conclusion, summer is an enjoyable time of year!**

---
<!-- PAGE 178 -->
<div align="left">148 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and
> details.
>
> T.S. The Renaissance was a time of tremendous advancements in many areas.
>
> art 1.  Michaelangelo/DaVinci
>
> education 2.  Gutenberg/printing press
>
> inventions 3. watches/microscope
>
> science 4. Copernicus/Galileo → astronomy
>
> C.S. **The 14th–17th centuries marked a time of major cultural change
> in Europe.**

As we discussed in Chapter 4, one way to make a sentence sound more
like a concluding one is to introduce it with an appropriate transition, such as
*finally* or *in conclusion*.

It’s best if the topic and concluding sentences don’t repeat the same
structure. For example, if the topic sentence includes an appositive, then
encourage students to use a different structure for the concluding sentence—
perhaps a subordinating conjunction or an exclamation.

### 11. Given Topic/Prompt, Construct SPO Independently

If students have been reading *Mae Among the Stars,*⁵ you might give them the
following activity.

---
<!-- PAGE 179 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 149</div>

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic.
>
> **TOPIC:** Mae Jemison
>
> T.S. **Mae Jemison dreamed of going to space.**
>
> 1.  **read books about space**
>
> 2.  **teacher suggested being nurse**
>
> 3.  **followed dream**
>
> 4.  **became astronaut**
>
> C.S. **Mae Jemison made her dream come true!**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic.
>
> **TOPIC:** Spanish-American War
>
> T.S. **The Spanish-American War of 1898 marked a turning point in both
> American and Spanish history.**
>
> 1.  **Cuba wanted independence from Spain/US support**
>
> 2.  **sinking USS Maine/Havana Harbor → tensions ↑**
>
> 3.  **Apr 1898 US declared war on Spain**
>
> 4.  **US victory/Dec 1898 Treaty of Paris → ended war**
>
> C.S. **The Spanish-American War led to the end of Spanish colonial rule and
> signaled the emergence of the United States as a global power.**

## SPO: Text Structures

An SPO enables students to use almost any text structure, including the
following standard ones:

*   Narrative
*   Descriptive
*   Problem/solution
*   Cause/effect
*   Pro/con
*   Compare-and-contrast
*   Opinion/persuasive

You can choose one of the following outlines for a whole-class introduc tion to adapting the SPO for different text structures, using the sequence of
steps described in the preceding sections. If your students have sufficient
knowledge about something they’ve already studied or are studying, you can
embed the activity in that content.

### Narrative

> T.S. **In 1912, the sinking of the Titanic, a luxury ship, was a disaster.**
>
> 1.  **built for safety/“unsinkable”**
>
> 2.  **speed/ignored signals → hit iceberg**
>
> 3.  **only 20 lifeboats/confusion**
>
> 4.  **1500 died/most 1st & 2nd class survived**
>
> C.S. **Many lessons were learned from this catastrophe.**

>
> 3.  **high speed telegraphs/elevator**
>
> 4.  **gym, pool, Turkish baths**
>
> C.S. **The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger ship of its time.**

## Turning an Outline
## into a Draft

After your students have put together a coherent SPO, they are ready to
convert the outline into a draft. They’ll need to expand their notes on the
dotted lines into complete sentences and add those sentences to the topic and
concluding sentences they’ve already written.

When students convert their SPOs into a draft, the resulting paragraph will
be logically organized, on topic, and non-repetitive. At the same time, though,
it may not be engaging to a reader. To make their writing flow, students will
need to apply the revision techniques that we’ll introduce in the next chapter.
Those techniques will draw on skills they’ve acquired through sentence-level
activities.

Bear in mind that leading your students through the process of developing
an SPO and later having them complete one independently is a valuable exer cise in itself, regardless of whether it results in a written paragraph. Creating
an outline deepens and cements students’ knowledge of the content it relates
to and develops their ability to make generalizations and put information into
a logical sequence. **Be sure to give your students plenty of opportunities to
develop outlines without turning them into drafts and final copies.**

### Differentiating SPO Activities

*   For students who need more support in completing an SPO, you can
    provide the topic or the concluding sentences—or both—and have them
    write in notes for the details. Students who need less support can come up
    with their topic and concluding sentences independently.
*   Have some students use only key words and phrases for their notes on the
    dotted lines, while having others use abbreviations and symbols as well.
*   If some students need more help coming up with details, you could
    provide them with cues in the margin while letting others come up with
    detail categories on their own.

<!-- PAGE 185 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 6 | A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline 155</div>

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   The SPO is linear and simple, enabling students to order details that support
>     the main idea and eliminate irrelevant information.
> *   Model the process of creating an entire SPO as a whole-class activity for both
>     Levels 1 and 2 before introducing activities that focus on the SPO scaffolds.
> *   To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence and learn to
>     organize and sequence details, use the SPO scaffolding activities.
> *   Build on students’ knowledge of sentences to introduce the strategies for
>     constructing topic and concluding sentences: sentence types, subordinating
>     conjunctions, and (for Level 2 students) appositives.
> *   Guide students through the process of creating non-repetitive concluding
>     sentences.
> *   As with sentence activities, it’s important to keep circling back to the SPO
>     scaffold activities to reinforce the skills used to develop SPOs and to serve as
>     comprehension checks.

### CHAPTER 7
# Revision
## Putting It All Together

> Over the course of the school year, Mr. Chambers’s fifth-grade students had
> acquired an impressive array of sentence-level skills. They’d learned how to use basic
> and subordinating conjunctions and transition words, and they’d practiced adding
> appositives and using question words to expand kernel sentences. Mr. Chambers
> had also led them through the process of constructing a Single-Paragraph Outline
> (SPO), and they seemed to have grasped it.
>
> At the end of a unit on insects, Mr. Chambers asked his students to write a
> paragraph on the life cycle of the butterfly. He was looking forward to seeing how
> they would apply the strategies they’d learned to their independent writing.
>
> But when he started reading through what his students had produced, his heart
> sank. The paragraph written by a student named Mara was typical:
>
> > The life cycle of a butterfly has four stages. The first one is the egg stage. The
> > second one is the larva stage. The third one is the pupa stage. The last one is
> > the adult stage. The life cycle of the butterfly is very interesting.
>
> The essential information was there—barely. Mara had also written complete
> sentences, stayed on topic, and created topic and concluding sentences. But the
> paragraph was wooden and boring.
>
> Mr. Chambers was sure Mara knew how to construct more complex, varied, and
> informative sentences as well as how to use transitions to make her writing flow.
> She and her classmates had done a good job with all of those strategies when given
> sentence-level activities to work on, or when Mr. Chambers made specific suggestions
> to, for example, add an appositive to a sentence. But it seemed that, for some reason,
> they weren’t able to apply those strategies to their own writing independently.

<!-- PAGE 188 -->
<div align="left">158 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

> What could he do, Mr. Chambers wondered, to enable them to internalize these
> strategies and become better independent writers? After all, he wasn’t always
> going to be there to suggest that they add an appositive or use a subordinating
> conjunction.

It’s crucial to teach students specific writing strategies and then have them
use activities you’ve modeled and created to practice those strategies. It’s
also crucial to give them targeted feedback on their writing. But that kind of
practice and feedback is often not enough to enable them to produce fluent,
graceful writing on their own. Of course, they need to learn how to edit their
writing. But first, and more important, students need to learn how to revise it.

> **WHY PRACTICE REVISION ACTIVITIES?**
>
> *   Leads to smoothly flowing, logically connected prose in paragraphs
>     and compositions
> *   Provides a way of incorporating substantive changes into a piece of
>     writing
> *   Enables students to use skills gained from sentence activities and
>     outlining when writing at length

Students may find revision challenging unless it’s presented as a step-by step process. Providing them with an array of activities—which we’ll demon strate in the following sections—will help.

## Revising versus Editing:
## An Important Distinction

Many people see the concepts of revising and editing as one and the same
since both processes are necessary to improve a piece of writing. For expe rienced writers, revising and editing may overlap, but when working with
your students you should teach the two processes separately. Understanding
the distinction between the two is a crucial first step in helping your students
transform a boring and disjointed piece of writing into one that engages the
reader and flows smoothly.

---
<!-- PAGE 189 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 159</div>

### Revising: Improving the Substance

**Revising** means clarifying or altering the content or structure of a draft. At
its core, revising requires writers to put themselves in the shoes of a reader,
anticipating what information that reader will need or want to know and
determining how to communicate it as effectively as possible.

Revising is what all good writers do, sometimes repeatedly, to make their
writing clear, accurate, and fluid. It can be as simple as substituting a powerful
adjective for one that falls flat or as complex as reorganizing the sequence
of ideas in an essay to make an argument stronger. For beginning writers, it
often involves turning simple rudimentary sentences into rich, complex ones
or elaborating on vague ideas with details and examples. For many writers,
it may mean eliminating unnecessary verbiage or streamlining convoluted
sentence structure.

To revise, students will build on the planning they engaged in when creat ing their SPOs. They will also draw on the skills they learned when practicing
the sentence-level activities, including harnessing the power of transitions to
make their writing flow.

### Editing: Polishing the Prose

**Editing**, although important, is often a less complex process. It involves iden tifying and then correcting errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization,
syntax, and spelling.

Most teachers focus on editing, probably because they are more comfort able with the mechanics and rules of writing. Similarly, if you ask students
to improve on a piece of writing, they’re likely to make mechanical changes
because, when they know the rules, it’s easier; adding a comma or capitalizing
a proper noun isn’t nearly as complex as imagining what a reader needs
to know or reorganizing the content of their writing. But it’s revising that
deserves the lion’s share of instructional time and students’ mental effort. To
the extent that students do revise, they rarely engage in it with the specificity
it requires.

---
<!-- PAGE 190 -->
<div align="left">160 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Experienced writers usually revise and edit simultaneously. However, it’s
best if students focus on revising *before* they edit. Only after students grow
familiar with the process of revising should they be expected to edit, proof read, and otherwise refine their work. Revising may change the wording and
structure of a piece of writing, so there’s no point in fine-tuning words and
passages that may disappear in the next draft. Editing an assignment before it
has been revised is like icing a cake before it’s fully baked.

However, that doesn’t mean that you should wait until students have
reached the editing stage to start correcting their mechanical errors. Even if
your objective is to help your students revise their work, you can still point
out spelling and punctuation errors without shaping an entire lesson around
them. At the end of this chapter, we’ll go into further detail on how and when
editing should be done.

## Revision Activities

The following activities support students’ ability to revise their work.

### Enriching Simple Sentences through
### Sentence Expansion

When your students convert the notes on their outlines into sentences on
their drafts, they may produce only brief, simple statements, as Mara did,
especially if they’re beginning writers. Although short declarative sentences
can provide emphasis and make facts clear, a steady succession of them
makes for wooden prose.

How can you guide students to expand these sentences into ones that are
longer and richer?

Remind them that when they’ve engaged in sentence expansion exercises,
they’ve used question words such as *who, what, when, where, why,* and
*how* to transform kernels into complex, information-packed sentences (see
Chapter 3). Now they can use the same kinds of questions to expand the
brief sentences in their drafts in order to provide more information to the

---
<!-- PAGE 191 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 161</div>

reader—and, if they need some help, you can provide the appropriate ques tion words as prompts.

For example, let’s say one of your students starts to use their outline to
draft a paragraph about the book *Frindle*¹ by Andrew Clements. They might
produce this simple sentence:

> Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle.”

At that point, you can ask: “Do you remember *why* he called it a ‘frindle’?”

The student might respond: “Because he wanted to perform a language
experiment and annoy his language arts teacher.”

“Great!” you can say. “How about expanding the sentence to include that
information?”

That prompt enables the student to turn their simple sentence into this:

> Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle” because he wanted to perform a
> language experiment and annoy his language arts teacher.

### Introducing Sentence Variety

Another way your students can liven up a boring draft is to vary their
sentences in length and type. Remind students of the four different sentence
types they can use (statement, question, exclamation, and command) and
the possibility of beginning a sentence with a subordinating conjunction (see
Chapter 4).

Perhaps, for example, one of your students writes a sentence about colonial
America that’s followed by another sentence or two using a similar structure:

> Colonists needed a way to travel and to water their crops. They settled
> near rivers.

---
<!-- PAGE 192 -->
<div align="left">162 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

You might say, “How about combining those two sentences? And how
about beginning with a subordinating conjunction?” The student might then
write the following:

> Since the colonists needed a way to travel and a way to water their crops,
> they settled near rivers.

If you’ve been regularly assigning your students activities that give them
practice with the various sentence-level strategies—embedded in the content
they’re studying—these techniques will be fresh in their minds.

### Revisiting Topic and Concluding Sentences

If your students have completed an SPO, they’ve already engaged in the pro cess of creating interesting and informative topic and concluding sentences
and writing them on an outline. As we detailed in Chapter 6, there are three
basic strategies for creating a topic sentence:

*   Choose one of the sentence types.
*   Begin the sentence with a subordinating conjunction.
*   Add an appositive.

<!-- Image of Exhibit 4.4 (repeated) -->

You may consider activities in which you would ask students to improve a
boring topic sentence as shown in the examples below.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a
> sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive.
>
> In this paragraph, I am going to tell you all about summer.
>
> 1.  **Enjoy summer!**
>
> 2.  **Although summer is a fantastic season, heat waves can be dangerous.**
>
> 3.  **Summer, a fantastic season, is popular with students because there is
>     no school.**

---
<!-- PAGE 193 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 163</div>

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a
> sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive.
>
> This paragraph is going to be about Genghis Khan.
>
> 1.  **Genghis Khan was one of the most powerful leaders in history.**
>
> 2.  **Although there have been many memorable leaders, Genghis Khan was
>     one of the most powerful.**
>
> 3.  **Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, created a large empire.**

### Choosing Vivid, Varied, and
### Precise Words

One way of enlivening a sentence is to use strong and varied nouns and
verbs, as well as modifiers and descriptive phrases. At first, you may need to
show Level 1 students where to place adjectives and descriptive phrases in
sentences, but eventually students will be able to find the correct placement
on their own.

If students favor overused, easy-to-spell adjectives such as *fun, nice,* or
*good*, encourage them to find descriptive words that are more specific. You
can brainstorm with students, provide them with a list of suggested alterna tive words, or explain how to use a thesaurus. Instead of *fun*, for example, a
student might substitute *exciting* or *sensational*. Instead of *good*, you might
suggest *enjoyable* or *fantastic*. It’s often a pleasant surprise to see the better
choices students make when they brainstorm for more precise and varied
alternatives.

---
<!-- PAGE 194 -->
<div align="left">164 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

If students have been reading *Because of Winn-Dixie,*² you might give them
the following activity:

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of adjectives for the bolded word below.
>
> Opal is a **nice** girl.
>
> **friendly respectful**
>
> **generous compassionate**
>
> **helpful kind**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of more precise words or phrases for each of the
> following bolded words or phrases.
>
> 1.  **A long time ago**, people fought for freedom.
>
>     **During the Revolutionary War In the late 18th century**
>
>     **From 1775 to 1783 During the colonial period**
>
>     **After the Boston Tea Party During the American War of Independence**
>
> 2.  A long time ago, **people** fought for freedom.
>
>     **the Continental Army colonists**
>
>     **the New England colonies revolutionaries**
>
>     **the Sons of Liberty Americans**

---
<!-- PAGE 195 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 165</div>

Two of the basic conjunctions, *but* and *so*, lead to more sophisticated
words that students should be encouraged to use in their independent
work. Remember that students should use the more sophisticated words in
Exhibit 7.1 at the beginning of their sentences rather than in the middle.

| but                      | so             |
| :----------------------- | :------------- |
| **change of direction**  | **cause → effect** |
| ↓                        | ↓              |
| Although                 | Therefore      |
| While                    | As a result    |
| Even though              | Since          |
| However                  | Consequently   |
| On the other hand        | Thus           |
**Exhibit 7.1**

### Using Transitions to Create Flow

Your students should be familiar with the transition words and phrases we
discussed in Chapter 4. If you guide them to insert appropriate transition
words and phrases during the revision process, their writing will become sig nificantly more fluid and coherent. To demonstrate how powerful these brief
insertions can be, show your students examples in literature or expository
writing and have them identify where transitions are used.

A transition may begin a sentence, creating a link between that sentence
and the one that has preceded it, or link thoughts within a sentence.
Transitions can also underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph’s
various sentences together.

If your students have trouble deciding what kind of transition to use when
revising, you can suggest a specific category from Appendix C for them to
look at. With enough practice, they’ll be able to find the right kind of transi tion independently.

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Transition Words
> and Phrases
> *Appendix C*

---
<!-- PAGE 196 -->
<div align="left">166 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Transitions—when used correctly—are vital to the creation of coherent
paragraphs and compositions. As a reminder, the basic types of transitions
and their functions are shown in Exhibit 7.2.

> **Types of Transitions**
>
> **Time and sequence**—provide sequence of events, steps in a process
>
> **Conclusion**—express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of
> view, solution
>
> **Illustration**—give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a
> statement
>
> **Change of direction**—signal contrasting thoughts
>
> **Emphasis**—prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously
> stated
**Exhibit 7.2 Transition Words and Phrases**

> **TECHNICAL TIP**
>
> The table of transitions in Appendix C describes the functions of the five types
> of transitions. It is not an exhaustive list, but the words and phrases we’ve
> focused on are the ones students are most likely to encounter in texts and
> literature. Consider giving students a copy of Appendix C to refer to when they
> are revising.

### Introducing the Unelaborated Paragraph

We often notice that students can apply TWR techniques when a teacher
provides them with structure, but then have difficulty when writing inde pendently. This issue usually emerges when students revise their drafts. A
student might, for example, improve a sentence by adding an appositive when
you specifically suggest that strategy, but he won’t come up with the idea on
his own.

An effective way to solve this problem and see improvement in students’
independent writing is by using the **unelaborated paragraph**. Students may
be reluctant to change their own writing after they’ve already invested some
effort in getting it down on paper. They may be far more likely to practice
revision strategies on a piece of writing composed by someone else.

> **WHY PRACTICE REVISING UNELABORATED PARAGRAPHS?**
>
> *   Helps students learn to use TWR strategies with careful scaffolding
>     and then apply them to their own writing independently
> *   Enables them to practice revision techniques on text for which they
>     don’t feel a sense of ownership
> *   Deepens their understanding of content
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

The idea is to give students a bare-bones paragraph consisting of four to six
simple sentences and then guide them through the process of improving it.

**Unelaborated paragraphs should have no errors in spelling, capitaliza tion, punctuation, or grammar so that students can focus on revision, not
editing.**

To enrich and expand the sentences and make the paragraph flow, students
will be drawing on the sentence-level strategies they’ve learned, including
their knowledge of transitions, and getting practice in using varied vocabu lary. Your directions to students for revising the paragraph should draw only
on skills that you have explicitly taught them.

---
<!-- PAGE 198 -->
<div align="left">168 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

As with all TWR activities, introduce the unelaborated paragraph as a
whole-class activity, under your guidance. Ideally, it should be embedded
in content students have studied. If that’s not possible, choose a subject
students know well. If they don’t have a command of the subject, students
won’t be able to provide the details they’ll need to improve and expand the
paragraph.

Here is a Level 1 example of what it might look like as students revise an
unelaborated paragraph.

#### Level 1 Example

Ms. Gold used the following unelaborated paragraph with her Level 1 stu dents about the class’s trip to the aquarium:

> The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch.
> The bus ride was fun. It was a very good field trip!

“This is a pretty boring paragraph, isn’t it?” Ms. Gold asked after posting
the paragraph in her classroom, and the students agreed. “Let’s see if we can
make it more interesting. *When* did we go to the aquarium?”

“Last week!” the students called out. Ms. Gold added the words *Last week*
to the beginning of the first sentence.

“Okay, great!” Ms. Gold said. “But what about this next sentence? *What*
could we add to that?”

“We could say, *we saw many different sea creatures*,” a student offered.

“That’s a good idea. What about the next sentence? *When* did we eat
lunch? *Where* did we eat lunch?”

---
<!-- PAGE 199 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 169</div>

As she made her way through the paragraph, Ms. Gold continued the pro cess of asking questions and adding students’ responses to the board. Other
questions she asked included the following:

> “Why was the bus ride fun?”
>
> “Can we think of a better word than *good* in the last sentence?”

After this, she gave the students a worksheet that reflected her discussion
with the class about how to revise the unelaborated paragraph.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow.
>
> The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch. The bus
> ride was fun. It was a very good field trip.
>
> 1.  Expand T.S. (when?)
>
> 2.  Sentence 2: Vary vocabulary, be specific (lots, fish)
>
> 3.  Sentence 3: Expand (when? where?)
>
> 4.  Sentence 4: Vary vocabulary (fun)
>
> 5.  Sentence 4: Expand (why?)
>
> 6.  C.S.: Vary vocabulary (good)
>
> **Last week, the third grade went to the aquarium. We saw fantastic sea
> creatures such as dolphins. Later, we had lunch outside at the picnic tables.
> The bus ride back to school was great because we had snacks and talked to
> our friends. It was a wonderful field trip!**

More experienced writers will be able to improve unelaborated paragraphs
with less scaffolding. But don’t stop giving such students unelaborated para graphs because you think they’re too easy! They continue to be an extremely
effective activity even for high school students as a check of comprehension
and as an opportunity to practice revision.

<div align="left">170 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 2 Example

Here is an example of a Level 2 activity. The class was studying the accom plishments of famous women in American history.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow.
>
> Eleanor Roosevelt was important. She was married to Franklin Roosevelt. She
> was the First Lady from 1933 to 1945. She made many contributions. Many people
> admired her.
>
> 1. Improve T.S. and C.S. 5. Vary vocabulary
>
> 2. Expand sentences 6. Use an appositive
>
> 3. Use transitions 7. Give examples
>
> 4. Combine sentences 8. Use a subordinating conjunction
>
> **Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most admired women of the 20th century,
> was the wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and First Lady from
> 1933 to 1945. Although she was born into great wealth and privilege, she
> was extremely aware of the injustices suffered by those less fortunate. She
> became a passionate advocate for human rights, and is remembered as an
> author and activist. After FDR’s death, President Harry Truman appointed
> her as a delegate to the United Nations, where she gained worldwide respect
> and received many honors and awards for her achievements. Truman called
> Eleanor Roosevelt the “First Lady of the World.”**

In composing this informative and smoothly flowing paragraph, students
are demonstrating their ability to create sophisticated sentences and a sense
of organization. At the same time, they are drawing on and deepening their
knowledge of the topic.

<!-- PAGE 201 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 171</div>

### Differentiating Unelaborated Paragraph
### Activities

*   Provide all students with the same bare-bones paragraph, but give
    some students fewer instructions for revision. For example, give some
    students a list of six things to do and limit others to only one or two.
*   Make directions explicit as opposed to general. For example:

    > *Explicit:* Use an appositive in the T.S.
    >
    > *General:* Improve T.S.
    >
    > *Explicit:* Add *where* to the fourth sentence.
    >
    > *General:* Expand sentences.

### Moving from Unelaborated Paragraphs
### to Independent Revision

The main goal of giving students unelaborated paragraphs is to enable them
to make similar revisions in their own writing without a teacher’s prompting.

The following steps will lead students to that goal:

1.  Revise an unelaborated paragraph as a class.
2.  Give students an unelaborated paragraph with explicit directions and
    have them work in pairs, small groups, or independently.
3.  Have students revise an unelaborated paragraph, without directions,
    independently, in pairs, or with a small group.
4.  Have students revise their own work after getting teacher feedback
    that reflects the language used in TWR strategies and activities—for
    example, “add a transition.”
5.  Have students revise their own work independently, using the
    techniques they have practiced.

As your students become accustomed to revising their writing, encourage
them to revise their drafts more than once. In fact, point out that in most
cases, the better the writer, the more times she will rework a draft.

---
<!-- PAGE 202 -->
<div align="left">172 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

It’s important to note that many lessons can end after revisions and
edits. A polished final copy of a paragraph or composition is not necessary to
achieve the lesson’s objectives.

Generally, introductory revision assignments should be kept brief. It’s
best for Level 1 writers to limit their revisions to one paragraph of five or six
sentences. That’s also true for more able writers who are still learning how to
make substantive revisions. If students write at greater length, they may find
it difficult to revise and edit and become discouraged. **Clarity and accuracy,
not length, are the goals.**

When students are writing by hand, stress that they should leave room on
their papers for revising and editing their drafts by skipping lines. If students
are using a computer, they should double or triple space for the same reason.
For drafting and revising written work and printing final copies, computers
are invaluable—as long as students learn keyboarding skills and become
proficient typists. If they have to hunt and peck at a keyboard, students will be
distracted during the complex process of composing.

### Giving Students Feedback

Feedback on drafts should be tailored to an individual student’s level of profi ciency. When your students are writing drafts, they may write sentences that
need to be expanded. With Level 1 students, your feedback should be explicit.
For example, you might insert *when?* or *why?* at specific points in their
writing. With Level 2 students, you will be able to just write *expand* on their
work. That should encourage them to consult the question word chart you’ve
posted on the wall, which can help them determine which of the question
words are relevant to their sentences.

After being taught how to construct sentences, craft SPOs, and use transi tions, students should be able to understand the following notes and abbre viations. This kind of feedback is far more helpful than just saying “make it
better” or “add more details” and hoping for the best.

---
<!-- PAGE 203 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 7 | Revision: Putting It All Together 173</div>

**BRIEF BUT TARGETED FEEDBACK**

**when? why?** [expand this point]

**ext w/ so →** [extend with so]

**ex.** [provide an example]

**app. in T.S.** [use an appositive in topic sentence]

**insert transition**

**sub. conj. in C.S.** [begin concluding sentence with a subordinating
conjunction]

**combine sent. 2 & 3**

A teacher might also point out, more generally, places where a student got
off track, using words like:

repetitive

irrelevant

Exhibit 7.3 is an example of feedback included directly on the draft.

<!-- Image of Exhibit 7.3: A handwritten paragraph with teacher's feedback annotations.
The paragraph is about Mansa Musa. Annotations include:
- "app." above "Mansa Musa" (start of sentence)
- "why?" next to "converted to Islam."
- "where?" above "pilgrimage"
- "combine" connecting the pilgrimage sentence with the spread of cultural practices sentence.
- "examples" above "cultural practices"
- "combine" connecting the Timbuktu sentence with the cultural center sentence.
- "examples" above "cultural center"
- "vary vocab" with an arrow pointing to "great impact" in the last sentence. -->
**Exhibit 7.3**

<div align="left">174 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

## Editing: Last but Not Least

Once students have a final draft, it’s time to proofread—that is, check for
errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. Many students,
especially those at Level 1, will need help spotting those errors and correct ing them.

As we discussed in Chapter 1, researchers have unanimously concluded
that teaching grammar rules in isolation doesn’t work for most students.
But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t teach grammar. **What *does* work
is to teach grammar—along with writing conventions such as spelling and
punctuation—in the context of the activities students are assigned or do
in class.**

In Chapters 2 and 4, we pointed out that it’s best, whenever possible,
to teach grammar and conventions in the context of sentence-level work,
where the number of errors is likely to be more manageable than in lengthier
student writing. But even if you’ve done that, most students will continue to
make at least some mechanical errors when they move on to paragraphs and
compositions—although perhaps not as many as they would have otherwise.
To give your students the skills that will enable them to avoid distracting
readers with technical mistakes, continue to identify and correct these errors
in your students’ drafts.

### Saving Time with Proofreading Symbols

If you familiarize your students with standard proofreading symbols, such as
a caret (^) to indicate an insertion, you’ll be able to use those symbols to give
quick and specific feedback on their writing during both the revision and edit ing stages. (You’ll find a list of proofreading symbols in Appendix D.) If you
simply circle a grammatical error such as a lack of subject-verb agreement,
there’s a good chance the student won’t understand what the problem is.

Take the time to make sure students know what mistakes they’ve made
and that they know how to correct them. There’s no other way to ensure that
they’ll learn the rules. Using symbols to communicate precisely what the
error is will make the revision and editing process much more efficient.

Busy teachers often have difficulty finding the time to provide detailed
feedback on students’ writing. But if you’ve laid the groundwork, you can pro vide shorthand feedback fairly quickly. And students will not only understand
your abbreviations but also know how to follow through on the suggestions
you’ve given them.

When students become more adept at revision, you may want to provide
them with the “Student Revise and Edit Checklist” in Appendix E, adapting
it as necessary to your students’ needs and level of ability. Students can then
go through the checklist on their own and ensure that their paragraphs and
compositions are the best they can be.

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   Revising, or making structural improvements to a draft, should be done before
>     editing, which consists primarily of correcting mechanical errors.
> *   To help students revise their drafts, remind them to use sentence expansion,
>     sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives, and sentence combining to vary their sentence structure.
> *   Encourage students to use vivid and precise words in the revision process.
> *   Transition words signal the connections between sentences and ideas and
>     create smoothly flowing prose.
> *   Before students try to revise their own writing, have them practice on unelab orated paragraphs that you provide.
> *   Use proofreading symbols and abbreviations for TWR strategies so feedback is

### CHAPTER 8
# Summarizing
## Finding the Main Idea of a Text

> Ms. Buxbaum’s eleventh-grade social studies class had been studying the American
> Revolution and its aftermath. She’d given her students an article to read on the
> Constitutional Convention and asked them to summarize it.
>
> Jamal’s summary went on for three pages, recounting details such as the names of
> the first few colonies to select delegates in the early months of 1787, the oppressive
> heat in Philadelphia that summer, and the introduction and rejection of the New
> Jersey Plan.
>
> Felicia’s summary, on the other hand, was just two simple sentences:
>
> > Delegates from the colonies met in Philadelphia. They drafted the Constitution.
>
> Neither of these summaries was exactly what Ms. Buxbaum had in mind.
> Jamal clearly knew a lot about the Constitutional Convention, but had trouble
> distinguishing important events from colorful but essentially irrelevant details.
> And Felicia’s summary had left out some crucial information—like when the
> Constitutional Convention had taken place.
>
> Ms. Buxbaum realized that students like Jamal and Felicia needed more guidance in
> exactly what a summary should include. But she wasn’t sure how to provide it.

Students often have trouble figuring out how much to say and what to focus
on when they’re asked to summarize. How much is too much? How much
is too little? What’s important and what’s not? Teachers’ guides may require
students as young as second grade to summarize a chapter or an entire book.
Yet even many high school students find it challenging to come up with a
good summary, struggling to find the right level of succinctness or detail.

<!-- PAGE 208 -->
<div align="left">178 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

## The Power of Writing
## Summaries

A **summary** is a brief statement that presents the main points of a text, in a
concise form, either in writing or orally.

Teachers sometimes underestimate the importance and the challenges
of having their students learn to craft effective summaries. Summarizing is
so powerful because it requires you to get to the essence of whatever you’re
trying to summarize. If you transfer a mental or oral summary to written
form, it can be especially powerful because you have to think even more
intensively about what you want to say. A written summary is also easier to
critique and rework. But writing also imposes a greater cognitive load than
thinking or speaking, and inexperienced writers can find it challenging to
create a written summary without explicit instruction.

Students at any grade or ability level can learn to summarize, although
your approach may vary depending on your students’ skill level, the com plexity and knowledge demands of the text, and other factors. The skills
students have acquired through learning to expand a sentence or create a
Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO) will give them a valuable boost in writing
summaries.

> **WHY PRACTICE SUMMARIZING?**
>
> *   Boosts reading comprehension
> *   Acts as a comprehension check
> *   Helps generate concise and accurate responses to questions
> *   Maintains focus on the main idea and most relevant details
> *   Teaches paraphrasing techniques
> *   Provides practice synthesizing information

<!-- PAGE 209 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 8 | Summarizing: Finding the Main Idea of a Text 179</div>

Summarizing information is something we all need to do, often many
times a day—and not only inside a classroom. Just to name a few examples,
summarizing comes into play when we’re asked to do any of the following:

*   Relate an experience or process
*   Describe someone or something
*   Sum up a plot
*   Give directions
*   Present a critical review

The difficulty of summarizing varies with the content, the complexity of
the language and syntax, and the depth of knowledge the reader has about the
topic. To see what we mean, try summarizing the following paragraph, which
appears on the first page of Immanuel Kant’s *Critique of Judgement*:¹

> We proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide Philosophy, as containing
> the principles of the rational cognition of things by means of concepts (not
> merely, as logic does, principles of the form of thought in general without
> distinction of Objects), into theoretical and practical. But then the concepts,
> which furnish their Object to the principles of this rational cognition, must be
> specifically distinct; otherwise, they would not justify a division, which always
> presupposes a contrast between the principles of the rational cognition
> belonging to the different parts of a science.

Not so simple, especially if you don’t have a graduate-level degree in
philosophy!

> **ASK THE EXPERTS**
>
> Reviews of multiple studies have found that summarizing can be a powerful boost
> to reading comprehension and learning.² When students are taught how to create
> summaries, the research has found that the practice helps them identify the main
> idea of a text, make generalizations, and retain information.
>
> One review of the research found that the effects were particularly strong in the
> elementary grades. It also found that writing summaries worked better than simply
> having students read a text multiple times, read and study it, or receive instruction
> in reading skills.³

---
<!-- PAGE 210 -->
<div align="left">180 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Teachers are often told they should have students summarize material,
but they’re not necessarily told why or how. Now that we’ve explained why
summarizing is important, we’ll tell you how to teach this critical skill.

## Three Questions to Ask before
## You Begin

Before you ask your students to start summarizing, there are three questions
you’ll need to answer first.

*   **Do your students have sufficient knowledge of the topic to
    summarize it?** It’s best to embed summarizing activities into the
    content you’re teaching and to ensure that you have spent enough
    time on that content to enable students to write about it intelligently.
*   **What is the purpose of the summary?** Is it a comprehension check
    you’ll collect or a study aid for your students?
*   **What is the format?** Will the summary be a single sentence, an
    outline, or a paragraph?

## Two Structures for Summaries

The following two formats, the summary sentence and the SPO, will help
your students structure their thoughts about the information they have read,
heard, or collected. Which one you use will depend on the text to be sum marized, the purpose of the summary, and the ability level of your students.
Both formats will require your students to go back into the text, read closely,
and find the main idea and most important points.

As always, it’s a good idea to complete these activities as a class before
asking students to try them on their own.

### The Summary Sentence

The first format, the **summary sentence** template, looks a lot like the one
your students have used for sentence expansion. The question words are the
same, and summarizing draws on many of the same skills as sentence expan sion, but there is no kernel sentence provided as a starting point. Instead,
students will be summarizing a specific text—a story, a paragraph, a book
chapter, or an article.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the summary sentence. It is not necessary to use all the
> question words. Respond only to the ones that are relevant.
>
> Who/What? **Maya**
>
> (did/will do) What? **built urban centers**
>
> When? **pre-Columbian era**
>
> Where? **throughout their empire**
>
> Why? **N/A**
>
> How? **expertly**
>
> **SUMMARY SENTENCE: During the pre-Columbian era, the Maya expertly
> built urban centers throughout their empire.**

When you give your students a text to summarize, clarify what you want
them to focus on when they create their summaries if the content lends itself
to several possibilities. When students are expanding a brief kernel sentence,
the focus is clear. But a paragraph, article, or chapter may cover a range of
possible subjects. If you want students to focus on one aspect of the text, be
sure to make that subject explicit.

For example, let’s say you’ve asked students to summarize an article about
tornadoes occurring in a particular state, and you expect them to focus on the

---
<!-- PAGE 212 -->
<div align="left">182 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

damage the tornadoes caused. Some students might choose to focus instead
on the timeline of the events or the areas and people that were impacted.
Unless you designate the subject, you may not get back the kind of summary
you anticipate.

In addition, make sure students know that they won’t need to answer all
the question words that are listed. When students are still learning to create
summary sentences, it’s important to guide them through thinking about
which question words will be relevant for a specific text and tell them that if a
certain word isn’t appropriate, they should put “N/A” (not applicable) on the
dotted line next to it.

Many newspapers and magazines summarize their articles in a single
sentence at the beginning as a way of letting readers know what will follow.
Often, book and movie reviews and television shows are summarized in a
single sentence. Consider showing your students how frequently this type of
brief summary appears.

**The end product of the summary sentence activity is an informative,
coherent sentence that could often work as the topic sentence of a para graph. Standing alone, it serves as a way of identifying the main idea of
a text.**

> **TEACHER TIPS**
>
> *   Have students create a summary sentence at the beginning of a class as a
>     do-now activity, based on homework or material that was previously covered.
> *   Review material that the class has covered. For example, if students have
>     been reading *Macbeth*, try having them summarize one of his soliloquies.
> *   Students should write their answers to the question words in the form of
>     notes on the dotted lines.
> *   Begin summary sentences with the answer to the *when* question, if that’s
>     appropriate for the text being summarized.
> *   Single-sentence summaries can be practiced orally, as a whole-class activity,
>     to help students stay concise and on topic.
> *   Be sure to post the question words prominently.

> **BE CAREFUL**
>
> Simpler texts, particularly those that have been “modified” or “adapted,” are harder

### Summarizing with the SPO

Students can use the SPO to plan a paragraph that provides a summary. Many
of the same skills they learned in connection with the SPO are also involved
in developing summaries:

*   Distinguishing between essential and nonessential information
*   Reducing text to notes or paraphrases
*   Organizing the points they want to make
*   Synthesizing information and making generalizations
*   Rephrasing a topic sentence as a concluding one

When students use the SPO for a summarizing activity, they will be
referring to a specific source and mining it for the information they’ll need to
complete the outline. Students will need to do the following:

*   Identify details that support the topic.
*   Generate a topic sentence.
*   Select and sequence supporting details.
*   Write the details as notes on the dotted lines.
*   Generate a complete concluding sentence.

When introducing summarizing, a sixth-grade teacher asked his students
to read an article about the importance of wearing the right sunglasses.⁴ Next,
the whole class developed the following SPO. The paragraph following the
SPO was written independently.

>
> 3.  **style/wrap-around**
>
> 4.  **cloudy days + winter → UV radiation**
>
> C.S. **In conclusion, wearing well-chosen sunglasses throughout the year is
> crucial for protecting the health of your eyes.**

> While cost and style are factors to consider when shopping for

> great damage, including cataracts. Look for a decal stating that the

> Wrap-around styles are best for protecting your eyes on all sides.
> Many people don’t know that UV radiation exists on cloudy days and
> during the winter. As a result, their eyes can be at risk. To conclude,
> be diligent when shopping for the safest sunglasses.

### BOOK DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1.  How does summarizing enhance comprehension?
2.  Describe the three conditions that need to be met before students begin to
    create a summary.
3.  How does the Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO) serve as a guide for writing a

If writing is hard, then writing at length only makes it harder. One reason it’s
important to start writing instruction at the sentence level is that it lessens
the heavy load that writing imposes on working memory, freeing up cogni tive capacity. But even if students have learned how to construct good sen tences, writing at length can still result in an overwhelming cognitive load.
Writers may need to juggle many complex items in working memory—for
example, keeping track of what they’ve already said or what they’re planning
to say next. That’s why linear outlines are so important: they can “offload”
some of that cognitive burden.

As students reach higher grade levels, they’re expected not only to write at
length but also to write well about topics beyond their personal experience,
which requires them to juggle that content in working memory along with
the demands of writing. A heavy emphasis on personal narratives in the
elementary grades often leaves students unprepared to meet those kinds of
writing expectations in middle and high school.

In response to that problem, many states have adopted standards requiring
that students write at length and in a variety of genres beginning in the ele mentary grades—informational and opinion essays as well as narratives. No
longer is it enough for a fourth grader to write a paragraph about his summer
vacation or a trip to the zoo. The standards may require him to be able to
write, for example, compositions that “introduce a topic or text clearly, state
an opinion, and create an organizational structure in which related ideas are
grouped to support the writer’s purpose.”¹

While it’s important to prepare younger students for the writing
demands they’ll encounter at higher grade levels, the standards tell us only
where students need to end up without explaining how to get them there.
Writing standards and assignments based on them are rarely grounded in
realistic expectations of children’s development, nor do they account for
the heavy cognitive load that writing imposes on inexperienced writers of
any age.

When asked to write at length in an expository mode, students at all grade
levels often struggle with sentence structure, organization, clarity, and coher ence. Simply handing out longer and more challenging writing assignments
doesn’t magically give students the skills they need to create well-crafted
compositions.

---
<!-- PAGE 219 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 189</div>

A **composition** (essay) is a series of paragraphs united by a common theme.
The characteristics of effective compositions mirror those of effective paragraphs:

*   **Structure.** The paragraphs are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity
    for the reader.
*   **Coherence.** The paragraphs are logically connected with appropriate
    transition words.
*   **Unity.** Every paragraph supports the main idea or thesis of the
    composition.
*   **Well-constructed sentences.** The sentences within each paragraph are
    grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures should
    vary (some simple, others compound or complex).

Over the course of many years, my colleagues and I have analyzed
countless compositions, research papers, and essays. After looking at both
long-term assignments and timed responses to essay questions on tests, we
realized that we needed a structured, sequenced method for guiding students
to compose longer pieces of writing. A crucial component of that method is
to explicitly teach students how to create a linear outline, building on what
they’ve learned about outlining a paragraph.

## The Benefits of Outlining

> **WHY PRACTICE OUTLINING FOR A COMPOSITION?**
>
> *   Reveals gaps in knowledge or comprehension to both teachers and
>     students
> *   Develops organizational skills
> *   Helps in categorizing information
> *   Provides students with a logical sequence for expository, narrative,
>     and argumentative text structures
> *   Avoids repetition and irrelevant information
> *   Promotes well-structured introductions and conclusions
> *   Develops efficient note-taking skills
> *   Strengthens the ability to create transitions between ideas and paragraphs
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

<!-- PAGE 220 -->
<div align="left">190 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Creating an outline will help your students cement knowledge they’ve
already acquired and gather new information that builds on it. Once students
are familiar with outlines and the associated skills, they’ll be able to repro duce outlines on scratch paper during tests and use them to write clearer and
more coherent responses.

**It’s important to remember that, as with the SPO, creating the outline
is a powerful activity in itself, regardless of whether a student turns it
into a draft or a finished product.** And, as always, it’s important to continue
sentence-level activities while students are learning to create outlines for
compositions.

## The Transition Outline and
## Multiple-Paragraph Outline

The **Transition Outline (TO)**, shown in Exhibit 9.1, is designed for students
who are ready to write more than one paragraph but not yet ready for the
task of writing complete introductions and conclusions.

A composition based on the TO begins with a single sentence, the **thesis
statement**, and ends with a single sentence, the **concluding statement**. Typically,
such one-sentence paragraphs are found only in fiction or journalistic writing.
Nevertheless, we believe it’s important to give students an easier option to intro duce and conclude a subject before teaching them how to write more fully devel oped introductions and conclusions, which we’ll describe later in this chapter.

Some students may be ready to move directly to the more challenging
**Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO)**, shown in Exhibit 9.2, without first
creating TOs.

Students who are familiar with the SPO but not ready for the format of the
TO or the MPO can use a **Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)**. The format of the
PTO can be found later in this chapter, under “Adapting the TO and MPO:
Pre-Transition Outline (PTO),” and in Appendix J.

You will need to use your judgment about what your students are equipped
to handle. In classes where there is a significant range of ability, you may
decide to provide some students with the TO and others with the MPO, even
if all are writing about the same content.

## Prepping for the TO and MPO

If you’ve given your students ample practice creating Single-Paragraph
Outlines (SPOs), they will have already acquired some of the prerequisite
skills needed for developing a TO on their own. Specifically, they will have
learned how to:

*   Write supporting details in note form, using key words and phrases,
    abbreviations, and symbols
*   Organize and categorize details

They’ll also need to acquire two new skills:

*   Generating a thesis statement that summarizes the theme or main
    idea of an entire essay
*   Generating a concluding statement that rephrases the thesis statement

To construct these statements, students will draw on and extend the gener alizing abilities they’ve acquired in summarizing and in composing topic and
concluding sentences for the SPO.

Similarly, when it’s time to draft and revise a composition using the TO,
students who have had experience writing paragraphs will already have
acquired some of the skills they need:

*   Creating topic sentences
*   Using a variety of sentence structures
*   Connecting sentences with transition words and phrases

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Pre-Transition
> Outline (PTO)
> *Appendix J*

---
<!-- PAGE 224 -->
<div align="left">194 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

But they will also need to acquire some new skills through repeated prac tice, including:

*   Expanding their use of transition words and phrases to connect
    paragraphs as well as sentences
*   Learning how to smoothly incorporate quotations from text into their
    writing

Level 2 students who are ready to move on to drafting and revising com positions using the MPO will also need to acquire another, more challenging
skill:

*   Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs that include not
    only a thesis statement but also at least two more sentences that
    provide a larger context for it

When you’re introducing students to the TO or the MPO, it’s best to
base writing assignments on what students have studied previously or are
currently learning, as long as they’ve had time to acquire a good deal of
information about the topic. Advanced Level 2 writers can be assigned topics
that require research.

We’ll begin by explaining how to guide students through the less complex
TO process and then discuss how to teach the skills required for the MPO
to those Level 2 students who are ready to tackle it. Argumentative compo sitions, which are particularly challenging, will be discussed in detail in the
next chapter.

## Introducing Students to the TO

Even after students are comfortable creating an SPO and using it to draft
a paragraph, they may still need more support before they’re ready for the
tasks required to write sophisticated essays. It’s not necessary to have them
start with three paragraphs and then progress to four or five. The length of a
composition should be determined by its topic and content.

Be sure to spend a lot of time developing a TO with the whole class fol lowing the sequence illustrated in Exhibit 9.3. As with the SPO, outlines don’t
necessarily have to be converted into drafts.

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING A TO**

1.  Select a topic and identify the purpose of the composition.
2.  Write the thesis statement.

---
<!-- PAGE 226 -->
<div align="left">196 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

3.  Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the
    Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the TO, with the abbreviation
    T.S. as a reminder to write a topic sentence.
4.  Write the details supporting the main idea in the right-hand column
    for each body paragraph. Use keywords, phrases, abbreviations, and
    symbols on the dotted lines.
5.  Write the concluding statement.

Each step in this sequence is discussed in the following sections.

### 1. Selecting a Topic and Identifying
### the Purpose

Students must know a topic well before they’ll be able to create a TO about
it. Book reports, current events related to scientific or geographic issues, and
biographies are all good topics.

The teacher, not the student, should select the topic for the TO, and—at
least at first—all students should be writing on the same topic. Students will
need practice before they can identify a topic on their own that’s appropriate
for a composition—one that’s neither too narrow nor too broad. The Civil
War, for example, is too broad, and a discussion of a specific minor battle
might be too narrow. A review of the military career of Ulysses S. Grant or an
analysis of the Battle of Gettysburg would work better.

Although students at higher grade levels will be writing about more com plex topics, they should not be expected to engage in independent research
while learning how to construct a TO. That would impose too great a burden
on working memory.

After the topic has been chosen, guide students in identifying the purpose
and the type of the composition. Will it be an expository, narrative, descrip tive, or opinion essay? More advanced writers can combine these structures,
but less experienced writers should stick to a single one. For background on
these different types of essays, see the discussion in Chapter 5.

### 2. Developing a Thesis Statement

A **thesis statement** is a statement that conveys the main theme of the entire
composition—just as a topic sentence conveys the main idea of a single
paragraph. A thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence at the
top of the TO. **The thesis statement and concluding statement are the only
complete sentences on the TO.**

Constructing a thesis statement requires that students understand the
main points they will be making in a composition and the text structure they
will adopt. At the same time, they’ll need to be able to state their thesis in a
single sentence—and one that is not too detailed.

Tyrell wrote a thesis statement that may remind you of sentences com posed by your own students:

> **In this essay, I am going to tell you about the many effects of
> the Civil War.**

Tyrell reveals his topic, but it is not obvious exactly what he is going to
tell us.

Students may benefit from a thesis statement that explicitly outlines a
**plan of development**. This means that the thesis statement presents the main
points of the composition in the order in which they will be addressed in the
composition. The plan of development provides a clear road map for the rest
of the outline.

With guidance, Tyrell rewrote his statement to include a plan of
development:

> **The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War
> lasted for generations.**

Exhibit 9.4 is a TO showing Tyrell’s thesis statement with a plan of
development: *economic, social, political*. Tyrell’s thesis statement signals to the
reader that the next paragraph of the essay will focus on the economic effects
of the Civil War. Then there will be a paragraph on the social effects, and
finally a paragraph on the political effects.

When your students are first learning to create thesis statements, tell them
they can draw on the three strategies for creating topic sentences that they’ve
already learned:

**Statement:**
> **The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted
> for generations.**

**Subordinating conjunction:**
> **Although the Civil War lasted only four years, its impacts on the economic,
> social, and political structures of the United States were enormous.**

**Appositive:**
> **The Civil War, a turning point in the country’s history, had major
> economic, social, and political effects.**

Students may choose not to include a plan of development, in which case
they can experiment with different structures. For example, a thesis statement
could simply say:

> **Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency marked the beginning of the United
> States as a world power.**

The essay could then address the specifics—the Panama Canal, the
Roosevelt Corollary—contained in that general idea.

You may find it helpful to provide students with examples of different
approaches they can use when developing their thesis statements:

**A personal judgment:**
> **It is urgent that problems associated with rising sea levels as a result
> of climate change be addressed worldwide.**

**Advice or directions:**
> **There are several strategies to combat the effect of rising sea levels.**

**A statement of consequences (cause and effect):**
> **If climate change is not addressed globally, coastal cities will be in danger.**

---
<!-- PAGE 230 -->
<div align="left">200 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

**An interpretation (usually of fiction or poetry):**
> **John Knowles’s widely read coming-of-age novel, *A Separate Peace*, presents
> themes of friendship, envy, and the effect of social class on relationships.**

**Compare and contrast:**
> **There are significant differences between the candidates regarding their
> positions on education.**

Even without a plan of development, students will be able to refer back to
their thesis statement to stay on track. Every paragraph in the composition
should relate to the theme contained in the thesis statement.

### 3. Developing the Main Idea Boxes

The column on the left side of the TO is headed “Main Idea.” The Main Idea
boxes are for words or phrases indicating the topic of each paragraph.

Unlike the SPO, the TO does not require students to write out the topic
sentences for their paragraphs. However, it can be helpful to have them write
the abbreviation T.S. in each Main Idea box to remind them to include topic
sentences for each paragraph when they compose their drafts.

Listing the main ideas in the left-hand boxes helps students avoid repe tition and ensures that each paragraph relates to the composition’s overall
theme.

Different types of compositions call for different kinds of main ideas for
the body paragraphs, as you can see from the following examples. The order
and number of the paragraphs also will depend on the type of assignment.

| BIOGRAPHICAL                 | BOOK REVIEW                  |

| Thesis statement             | Thesis statement             |
| *   Early life               | *   Book summary             |
| *   Major accomplishment(s)  | *   Opinion                  |
| *   Legacy                   | Concluding statement         |

| **COMPARE AND CONTRAST**     | **MAJOR EVENT**              |
| Thesis statement             | Thesis statement             |
| *   Similarities             | *   Background               |
| *   Differences              | *   Event                    |
| Concluding statement         | *   Impact                   |
|                              | Concluding statement         |

### 4. Developing the Details

The Details boxes are on the right side of the outline. These boxes have dotted
lines where students write notes using key words and phrases, abbreviations,
and symbols that will form the basis of their body paragraphs. Students
should have sufficient background knowledge to provide at least three details
for each paragraph.

**Make sure students understand that they should write the details for
each paragraph in note form rather than in full sentences.** Although
students need to settle on the order of the paragraphs when creating the TO,
the order of the details may not matter at this point. Students can revise their
outlines or change the order of the details when it’s time to write their drafts.

### 5. Writing the Concluding Statement

The function of a concluding statement is to restate and reinforce the thesis
statement of the composition. A concluding statement usually does one of the
following:

*   Summarize
*   Offer a solution or recommendation
*   Pose a question
*   Justify a position
*   Present a point of view

---
<!-- PAGE 232 -->
<div align="left">202 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Here are some examples of possible concluding statements, along with
thesis statements for the same essays:

**EXAMPLE 1:**
Thesis statement:
> **The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for
> generations.**

Concluding statement (summary):
> **In summary, the impact of the Civil War was felt for many years after
> the fighting ended.**

**EXAMPLE 2:**
Thesis statement:
> **If climate change is not addressed worldwide, coastal cities will be in
> danger.**

Concluding statement (solution or recommendation):
> **To conclude, nations must work together to prevent rising sea levels from
> causing widespread destruction.**

**EXAMPLE 3:**
Thesis statement:
> **Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency saw the development of the national parks.**

Concluding statement:
> **One of Theodore Roosevelt’s most important legacies was his approach to
> conservation.**

Students do not need to write concluding sentences for each paragraph in
a multiple-paragraph composition.

## Using a Transition Outline to
## Write an Essay

Converting a TO into a draft should be an efficient process. Students will
know what their topic is, the basics of what they want to say, and the order
in which they want to say it. In the drafting and revising process, they
can devote their mental energy to crafting clear, interesting, and varied
sentences—including topic sentences for their body paragraphs—and using
transitions to create a coherent and effective composition.

When students revise their drafts, the benefits of continuing to work on
sentence-level activities alongside lengthier writing become clear. Those activities
will continue to help students remember to apply strategies like varying their sen tence structure and including information their intended audience might need.
Students may also need to cite evidence from texts and incorporate quotations.

### Using Transitions to Link Paragraphs

Transitions enhance coherence and flow in longer pieces of writing. When your
students are converting TOs into drafts of compositions and revising them,
remind them to use transitions to link one paragraph to the next. Virtually
any of the transitions they’ve learned to connect sentences can also be used to
connect paragraphs. See Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases.”

For example, if a student is writing a compare-and-contrast composition
about red and white blood cells and she has written one paragraph about red
blood cells and the next about white blood cells, she can use a change-of direction transition to create a link between the two paragraphs:

> Red blood cells carry respiratory gases throughout the body. These cells
> lack a nucleus, which means that there is room inside each cell for more of
> a pigment called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their color
> and is responsible for carrying oxygen around the body. Red blood cells also
> transport carbon dioxide.
>
> **On the other hand,** white blood cells fight infection. These cells circulate
> throughout the bloodstream and tissues to attack unknown organisms that may
> cause an illness or injury. Unlike red blood cells, white blood cells have a nucleus.

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Transition Words
> and Phrases
> *Appendix C*

<div align="left">204 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### Incorporating Quotations

When students begin to write longer compositions, they are often encouraged
not just to cite evidence from texts but also to quote from them directly.
When students are creating outlines, they should be taught how to include
the page number(s) and source(s) of the quotation(s) they plan to use. If they
are using more than one source, they will need to include the author as well.

Too frequently, students will use a quotation without providing any
context, introduction, or attribution. In addition, it’s often not clear why
students have chosen a particular quotation. They may assume its meaning
and relevance are obvious, or they may not have fully understood the words
themselves. At times it seems that students are inserting a quotation simply to
prove they’ve read the text rather than to support the point they’re making.

If you want your students to use quotations effectively, you have to show
them how to be judicious about selecting the text they want to quote and
how to incorporate that text smoothly into their own writing. They’ll need to
answer these questions:

> What does the quotation mean?
>
> Whose words are they?
>
> How does the quotation support the point I’m making?

#### Understanding the Quotation

To ensure that students actually understand the words they’re quoting, ask
them to paraphrase the quotation for you. For example:

> Quotation: “Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women
> everywhere.”
>
> Paraphrased quotation: No matter where suffering happens and who is
> affected, it has an impact everywhere and on everyone.

---
<!-- PAGE 235 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 205</div>

Once they’ve done that, students should make sure they know the source
of the quotation and whether that source or speaker is reliable. Then they can
ask themselves if the quotation belongs in the spot where they’re intending
to use it. If it does, they can include the source of the quotation and page
number on an appropriate detail line of their TO.

#### Determining What’s Noteworthy

It’s helpful to explain to students that a longer quote isn’t always a better
quote. A succinct phrase may have more impact than a discussion that goes
on for several lines.

Nor is it always necessary for students to include a direct quotation.
Paraphrasing text often works just as well. However, even if a quotation is
paraphrased, students should include an attribution to the text on which
it’s based.

Quotations should be reserved for instances when the author of the text
has said something particularly noteworthy. Consider guiding your students
in identifying those distinctive quotations before they attempt to select them
independently.

#### Weaving In Quotations

Once they’ve settled on a quotation that is on point and worthy of inclusion,
students will need to learn how to weave it into their own writing.

The book *They Say/I Say*² suggests introducing quotations using phrases
like these:

> Jones states, “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
>
> As the author of the article argues, “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”
>
> According to Jones, “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

Okay, I will continue converting the OCR text into an exact Markdown representation, picking up from where your current version leaves off (page 237 of the PDF).

---
<!-- PAGE 237 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 207</div>

The authors also suggest following up the quotation with an explanation
that paraphrases it. For example,

> In other words, Jones is saying \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## The MPO for Level 2 Students

If your Level 2 students have already had practice with the TO, most of the steps involved in creating the MPO will be familiar.

If they haven’t had that practice, guide them through these activities, all of which are described in detail in the previous section:

**OUTLINING**
*   Select a topic and identify the purpose.
*   Develop a thesis statement.
*   Fill in the Main Idea boxes.
*   Fill in the Details boxes.
*   Write a concluding statement.

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**
*   Use transitions to link paragraphs.
*   Incorporate quotations.

A significant difference between the TO and the MPO is that instead of writing a thesis statement as a stand-alone sentence, students will now create a multi-sentence introductory paragraph composed of a thesis statement as well as general and specific statements. The same is true for a concluding paragraph. This process often requires a good deal of guidance and practice.

Constructing an MPO involves six steps. The sequence of the steps corre sponds to the numbers that appear on the sample MPO template in Exhibit 9.6. MPOs can have three, four, five, or more paragraphs. As we noted earlier, students don’t have to start with three-paragraph MPOs and then progress to longer ones. The number of paragraphs assigned should depend on the topic and the content.

As with the SPO and TO, you should spend a lot of time developing MPOs with the whole class before expecting students to develop an MPO independently.

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING AN MPO**
1.  Select a topic and identify the composition’s purpose.
2.  Develop the thesis statement as a complete sentence on the solid line
    at the top of the outline. Tell students that this is the only time they’ll
    write a complete sentence on the MPO.
3.  Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the
    Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the MPO and include T.S. as
    a reminder to create a topic sentence later when drafting.
4.  Write the supporting details for each main idea in the Details boxes in
    the right-hand column of the MPO.
5.  Indicate the structure of the introductory paragraph by writing the
    letters G (for *general* statement), S (for *specific* statement), and T (for
    *thesis* statement). The statements themselves should be created only
    after the outline is done.
6.  For the concluding paragraph, invert the order of the introduction to
    T, S, and G.

Steps 1–4 have been described previously, but steps 5 and 6 are new
and specific to the MPO. The next section will define GST and TSG and
describe the process of using them as a guide to develop introductions and
conclusions.

## Using the MPO to Draft and
## Revise Compositions

Converting an MPO to a draft is more challenging than undertaking that
process with a TO because students will need to create general and specific
statements during the drafting process. They will need ample practice with
the preparatory activities described in this section.

---
<!-- PAGE 241 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 211</div>

Don’t forget that students should use transition words and phrases to
connect their paragraphs and smoothly incorporate quotations, as discussed
previously in this chapter.

### Introductions: The GST Structure

Introductions set forth the topic of the composition and should engage the
reader’s interest. Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs requires
the ability to summarize information and make generalizations at an even
more sophisticated level than that required for writing only the thesis
statement.

Both introductory and concluding paragraphs should consist of at least
three sentences. In addition to the thesis statement, students will also need
to learn how to construct general and specific statements that support their
thesis. This process, which is described in *The St. Martin’s Handbook,⁶* will
result in coherent paragraphs that provide context for the thesis statement.

Some teachers may believe that the GST format makes students’ intro ductions too formulaic. But the fact is that most developing writers actually
need and appreciate a formula to help them structure coherent introductions
and conclusions. We have seen this technique applied in sophisticated essays
written by experienced writers.

According to the handbook, introductory paragraphs should unfold in this
order:

1.  First sentence: general statement (G)
    **There are books that were written decades ago that are relevant today
    because of their timely themes.**
2.  Second sentence: specific statement (S)
    **The Great Gatsby has fascinated readers over the years because of its
    focus on extreme wealth, unbridled materialism, and the decay of social
    and moral values.**
3.  Third sentence: thesis statement (T)
    **Although the book was published in 1925, the characters, the setting, and
    the conflicts resonate with present-day readers.**

---
<!-- PAGE 242 -->
<div align="left">212 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Using the GST format can be challenging. Even students who have had
experience crafting thesis statements may need support in coming up with
general and specific statements. One way to provide that support is to model
or guide them through the process.

#### GST: Classroom Example

Using the topic of Nelson Mandela, whom the class had been studying, Ms.
Jackson began by asking her tenth graders to come up with a **thesis state ment** about him. After some discussion, the class agreed on the following:

> **Nelson Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of
> apartheid and his election as South Africa’s first Black president.**

After completing the Main Idea and Details boxes for the composition
with the whole class, Ms. Jackson asked the students what general category of
individuals they thought Mandela belonged to. One student said, “freedom
fighters”; another said, “civil rights activists”; and a third suggested “people
who had a big effect on history.” Ms. Jackson chose the third phrasing, and
collectively the class wrote:

> **During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant
> impact on history.**

Ms. Jackson told the class that could be their **general statement**. Now,
she said, it was time to narrow the focus to come up with a more **specific
statement**, perhaps by placing Mandela in a particular place. The students
came up with “South Africa.” Ms. Jackson asked them to try writing a specific
statement using an appositive. After comparing their different formulations,
the class agreed on this one:

> **Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle for equal rights for
> all citizens, brought great change to South Africa.**

---
<!-- PAGE 243 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 213</div>

The class then put all three sentences together to form an introductory
paragraph using the GST format:

> **During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant
> impact on history. Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle
> for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South
> Africa. Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of
> apartheid and his election as South Africa’s first Black president.**

Here are two additional examples of introductory paragraphs that follow
the GST format. The words in bold indicate elements of the plans of develop ment that are embedded in the thesis statements.

**BOOK REPORT**

[G] Only a few of the countless books published each year become
classics. [S] William Golding’s novel about a group of British schoolboys
stranded on an island after a plane crash has been required reading
in many schools for decades. [T] *Lord of the Flies* has intrigued readers
because of its **plot, characters,** and **the lessons** that can be learned
from this compelling tale.

**SIGNIFICANT EVENT**

[G] All of the great presidents have a signature achievement that
profoundly affected future generations. [S] The acquisition of the
Louisiana Territory from France is considered by many to be Thomas
Jefferson’s outstanding accomplishment. [T] As a result of the Louisiana
Purchase, he significantly **increased the size of the United States,
extended its borders,** and **opened up new trade routes.**

### Writing General, Specific, and Thesis
### Statements

The amount of time you spend teaching your students how to develop gen eral, specific, and thesis statements will vary depending on their abilities and
the complexity of the content they’re studying.

---
<!-- PAGE 244 -->
<div align="left">214 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

The following kinds of activities should be modeled and practiced
frequently with the entire class before you have students try them inde pendently. The following activities are listed in the sequence in which they
should be introduced.

#### 1. Write a Thesis Statement (T) When Given a Topic

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a thesis statement (T) for the given topic.
>
> **TOPIC:** Napoleon’s impact
>
> T: **Napoleon’s impact on France had both positive and negative aspects.**

#### 2. Distinguish among General (G), Specific (S), and
#### Thesis (T) Statements

> **DIRECTIONS:** Identify the general statement, specific statement, and thesis
> statement by writing G, S, or T.
>
> **S** In 1936, an athlete impressed spectators at the Berlin Olympics with
> his skill and talent.
>
> **T** Jesse Owens, a formidable Black track and field star, is remembered for
> shattering world records.
>
> **G** Many Olympians have made a significant impact on their sport.

---
<!-- PAGE 245 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 215</div>

#### 3. Write an S When Given a G and a T

If students are having trouble coming up with a specific statement, you can
suggest that they try answering one or more of the question words (*who,
what, when, where, why,* and *how*). Another good option is to include an
appositive. The following example assumes students have read the book
*Lyddie*.⁷

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a specific statement (S) for the given general statement (G) and
> thesis statement (T).
>
> G: People often have different ideas of how to define “fairness.”
>
> S: **Diana and Lyddie, two characters in Katherine Paterson’s novel *Lyddie*,
> have differing points of view.**
>
> T: Although Diana is radical and tries to entice other factory workers to sign a
> petition, Lyddie does not agree with Diana’s perspective until the very end of the
> novel.

#### 4. Write a G and an S When Given a T

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write a general statement (G) and a specific statement (S) for the
> given thesis statement (T).
>
> G: **An invasive species is an organism that is not native to a particular area.**
>
> S: **In the Florida everglades, the Burmese python has been wreaking havoc
> on native animal populations since it was first introduced to the area
> in 1994.**
>
> T: Although these enormous reptiles continue to pose a problem for this once thriving ecosystem, scientists in Florida are developing methods to reduce their
> numbers.

---
<!-- PAGE 246 -->
<div align="left">216 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### 5. Adding Sentences to the Introductory Paragraph

As students become more proficient, there is no need to limit their introduc tions to three sentences. Typically, the fourth or fifth sentences are specific
statements, often facts or statistics.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write an additional specific statement (S).
>
> G: As the United States grew in industrial and economic power, two controversial
> figures emerged.
>
> S: By the end of the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie controlled almost the entire
> steel industry and John Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company controlled 90% of the
> refining business.
>
> S: **Both men made tremendous philanthropic contributions that made them
> heroic in the views of many.**
>
> T: However, there have been debates about whether these early builders of big
> business in America should be considered “robber barons” or “captains of
> industry.”

### Crafting Conclusions

As with the concluding statement in the TO, the function of the concluding
paragraph in the MPO is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of
the composition. It should accomplish at least one of the same goals as
the TO concluding statement, such as offering a summary, solution, or
recommendation.

The structure of the concluding paragraph reverses the structure of the
introductory one: instead of GST, the concluding paragraph follows a TSG
pattern. The thesis statement should be rephrased and positioned as the first
sentence instead of the last.

---
<!-- PAGE 247 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 217</div>

Consider these examples of an introduction and conclusion following the
GST and TSG formats on the topic of the monarch butterfly.

**INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:**

> The migration of the monarch butterfly has always been fascinating
> to scientists. However, there are both habitat and environmental factors
> that pose threats to this favorite flying insect. Even though historically the
> monarch butterfly population has come back from challenges that have
> threatened its existence, recovering from the use of pesticides, climate
> change, and development may be more problematic.

**CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH:**

> Although monarch butterflies have bounced back from past threats
> caused by nature, the hazards caused by people may be too monumental for
> this popular butterfly population to overcome. Concerns about the future of
> the monarch are valid and serious. It is imperative to address the dangers
> confronting this remarkable butterfly before it becomes extinct.

Remind students that the last words in a composition usually have the
most impact on the reader; therefore, the concluding paragraph should con tain its key points. After the first sentence, which will be the rephrased thesis
statement, students should write specific and general statements that differ
from the ones they used in their introductory paragraph. Both should expand
on the S and G statements that appear there. If students are having trouble
rephrasing the three types of statements in their conclusions, you can provide
them with some sample introductory paragraphs and have them practice
reconstructing them as concluding paragraphs.

Examples 9.7 and 9.8 show a completed MPO and the essay it outlines.

  <b>Title:</b><br>
  <b>Two Primary Causes of the American Revolution</b>
</div>

The factors that led to the American Revolution have been described
by countless historians. There were multiple events that played a
role in the colonists’ rebellion, but two are especially important. The
Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were crucial in the decision to
declare war on Great Britain.

In 1774, the British wanted to make an example of Massachusetts
after the Boston Tea Party. As a result, the Intolerable Acts, a group
of four acts, were passed. They denied Massachusetts the right to
govern itself. In addition, Boston Harbor was blockaded, and fair
trials were prevented. Finally, the last act applied to all the colonies,
not just Massachusetts. British troops were ordered to be stationed
at more convenient locations and the expenses were to be paid by
the colonies.

In 1765, the Stamp Act was intended to raise money from the
colonists by taxing all printed paper, even playing cards, but it was
enacted without the approval of their assemblies. The colonists
believed they should have the same rights as the English. Patrick
Henry’s publication attacking the act, Virginia Resolves, was widely
read. The phrase “taxation without representation” became popular.

The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were primary reasons
for the American Revolution. As a result of the burdens these acts
placed on the colonists, their fury grew. Their anger eventually led to
a strong desire for independence from Great Britain.

### Differentiating TO and MPO Activities

Practice in any of the preceding activities can help students who are having
difficulty with particular elements of the TO and MPO. Here are some fur ther suggestions you can use for additional support:

*   TO: Provide students with the thesis and concluding statement(s).
*   TO and MPO: Provide students with the thesis statement and words
    and phrases for the Main Idea column to help them organize their
    paragraphs.
*   TO and MPO: Provide students with both a main idea and details for
    the first body paragraph.
*   MPO: Provide Level 2 students who are ready for the MPO with a
    thesis statement and/or the general or specific statements to use in
    their introduction and conclusion.

### Adapting the TO and MPO:
### The Pre-Transition Outline

For students, particularly those in elementary school, who are not ready
for the TO or MPO formats, we suggest using a hybrid of an SPO and TO,
the **Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)**, to help them begin thinking about the
requirements of MPOs and essays. As with the TO, for the PTO students
select the topic first and then develop a thesis statement. In contrast to the
TO, on the PTO students write out a full topic sentence for each paragraph as
they would on an SPO; however, they do not need to add a concluding sen tence for each paragraph. Instead, the PTO ends with a concluding statement
that paraphrases the thesis statement.

It’s best if the PTO is only two or three paragraphs long and has three or
four details. The fourth detail is in parentheses to indicate that it is considered
optional depending on the topic. See the following example of a completed
PTO. (Also see Appendix J.)

>
> Pre-Transition
> Outline (PTO)
> *Appendix J*

---
<!-- PAGE 251 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 221</div>

When students have mastered completing the PTO and developing drafts
based on it, move right on to the TO. It’s preferable to have students become
accustomed to the TO sooner rather than later because, together with the
MPO, those formats will be more beneficial to students as they write longer
essays about more complex and detailed topics.

## Research Papers

Teaching students effective research skills is challenging but important. If
students haven’t learned how to research a topic, they may find themselves
investing a lot of effort in a project that relies on information that is question able or just plain wrong.

It’s all too easy for students to stumble on a website that looks reliable but
is riddled with misinformation. Students may also mistake personal opinions
they find online for fact or become overwhelmed by the amount of informa tion available.

Make sure your students are staying on track over the days or weeks that
they’re working on their projects. Once students have their topics, it’s best
to set up a detailed schedule listing due dates for each stage of the process:
gathering material, developing a thesis, coming up with a bibliography, taking
and organizing notes, and so on. We suggest that you require students to get
your approval for each section before moving on to the next step.

A full discussion of how to help your students do research online is beyond
the scope of this book, but we can offer a few suggestions. We also recom mend consulting the article “The Challenge That’s Bigger than Fake News:
Civic Reasoning in a Social Media Environment,” published in *American
Educator* magazine and authored by a group of researchers at Stanford
University.⁸

### Surfing the Internet—with Guardrails

Model the process of searching online for the class, just as you model TWR
strategies and activities. Tell students that when they look for information
and evidence on the internet, it’s important to be aware of the following
guidelines and search suggestions, which are drawn from the aforementioned
*American Educator* article as well as an article in *Education Week* on teaching
online research skills:⁹

*   Use precise keywords in online searches. Typing *Kennedy
    assassination* might return results about the assassinations of both
    John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy instead of just one of them.

---
<!-- PAGE 253 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 9 | Moving On to Compositions 223</div>

*   Use certain words and symbols to refine online searches.
    *   Use quotation marks around search terms to get the exact
        wording.
    *   Insert “AND” between search terms to produce results that focus
        on both subjects.
    *   Include a space followed by a minus sign to eliminate a
        particular meaning of a term (for example, a student searching
        for information about the Australian Outback could type
        *Outback -car* to eliminate results relating to the Outback vehicle).
*   Check whether a website’s URL ends in *.com, .gov,* or *.edu*. Websites
    connected with a government agency (*.gov*) or university (*.edu*)
    are generally more trustworthy than someone’s personal website.
    But warn students that *.org*, previously associated with mission driven organizations, is no longer a sign of reliability; practically any
    organization can now obtain that designation.
*   Evaluate websites with a critical eye. Students should be asking
    questions such as: Who wrote this? What is his or her perspective?
    Who is sponsoring this site? Are there links and references to other
    sources that corroborate the information? Asking these questions
    while on the site itself may not be enough. It can be more useful to
    leave the site and see what other sources say about it.
*   Don’t click on the first result that comes up after a Google search. It’s
    best to go down the list and examine URLs and the sentences that
    accompany each result for clues to reliability.
*   Use Wikipedia wisely. Although many educators warn students away
    from the site, it can be useful if you know how to use it. Students
    should learn to investigate Wikipedia’s “Talk” pages, where they’ll find
    debates on controversial issues, and to use the references at the end of
    each article as resources for lateral reading.

### CHAPTER 10
# Taking a Stand
## Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and
## Argumentative Essays

> Ms. Giannelli was familiar with the state writing standards that applied to her
> seventh graders. She knew they needed to be able to write arguments in which
> they supported their claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence, while
> acknowledging another point of view.
>
> After searching online for argumentative writing prompts, Ms. Giannelli found a
> wealth of ideas for middle schoolers. She decided to give her class a choice of just
> three topics:
>
> *   Should cell phones be allowed at school?
> *   Should students have homework on weekends?
> *   Should exotic animals be kept in captivity?
>
> Ms. Giannelli knew her students had lots of opinions on the first two questions, and
> she suspected the third one would appeal to the animal lovers in the class. To help
> them get started on a topic they might not know much about, she provided the two
> sentences that had accompanied the prompt online: “Many exotic animals live longer
> in captivity. However, many people argue that it’s not a good way of life for them.”
>
> Ms. Giannelli was pleased to see that as students chose their topics, there was a
> buzz of excitement in the air. After about half an hour, she decided to check their
> progress.
>
> Some students seemed to have gotten stuck after the first sentence or two—
> especially those who had chosen to write about animals in captivity. Most were
> against the idea, but they had trouble coming up with reasons beyond their
> conviction that the animals would be unhappy.

---
<!-- PAGE 258 -->
<div align="left">228 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

> Students who chose one of the other topics had produced more prose, but it wasn’t
> what Ms. Giannelli had hoped for. Ari’s essay was pretty typical. She took a strong
> stand against homework on weekends. But her reasons were entirely personal. She
> explained how tired she was after school on Fridays and listed all the activities she
> would like to engage in during a typical weekend. Ms. Giannelli didn’t think these
> reasons counted as “evidence.” Nor did Ari acknowledge that anyone else might
> think homework on weekends was a good idea, let alone raise the arguments such a
> person might make and try to rebut them.
>
> The standards were clear, and it was equally clear Ms. Giannelli’s students weren’t
> equipped to meet them. What wasn’t clear was what she could do about that.

Teachers frequently assign opinion and argumentative essays to satisfy the
requirements of state writing standards. Children as young as third grade are
expected to present their claims and convince a reader of their point of view.
By sixth grade, they’re supposed to be supporting their claims with evidence,
and by seventh grade they should be acknowledging arguments on the other
side. As we have discovered, even older students often struggle to write these
kinds of essays if they haven’t learned the appropriate language and structures.

When you have students practice the skills leading up to argumentative writ ing, choose a topic that has two debatable sides. Whenever possible, the topic
should be embedded in the content students are studying. Often opinion or
argumentative writing is treated as a separate category that can be addressed
only by having students take and defend positions on topics beyond the
school curriculum—such as the pros and cons of school uniforms. However,
choosing a topic they’ve been studying is an ideal way to build and deepen their
knowledge of content. Stay alert for topics in the curriculum, at whatever grade
level you’re teaching, that lend themselves to pro/con writing. For example,
students can write about the pros and cons of traveling west in covered wagons,
the strengths and weaknesses or flaws in a particular book or character, or
arguments for and against using atomic bombs to attack Japan in World War II.

If you’ve been using TWR’s method, your students have already been
building the skills they’ll need to craft effective arguments:

*   Completing sentence stems using *because, but,* and *so* develops
    students’ ability to connect a **claim** to evidence, introduce a
    **counterclaim**, and describe cause/effect relationships.

---
<!-- PAGE 259 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 229</div>

*   Using subordinating conjunctions such as *while* and *although*
    and transitions such as *however* and *on the other hand* to begin
    sentences enables students to acknowledge or make a claim while
    simultaneously bringing in an opposing claim.
*   Sentence expansion using a kernel that takes a position develops
    students’ ability to state a claim.
*   Transitions present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims.
*   Creating topic sentences and thesis statements enables students to
    identify the main points they want to make in an argument.
*   Summarizing develops students’ ability to succinctly describe claims
    on both sides.
*   Creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs that are either pro or con),
    Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs)
    helps students logically organize claims and evidence.
*   Incorporating quotations and paraphrases during the revision process
    teaches students how to cite evidence for claims in an effective way.

As we emphasize throughout this book, however, these strategies will help
students write well only if they have knowledge of what they’re writing about.
That applies to argumentative writing as much as to any other genre.

## Preparing for
## Argumentative Writing

Often students approach argumentative writing by progressing along three
types of paragraphs and compositions:

*   **Opinion:** Author tries to convince a reader to adopt a certain point
    of view; opinion writing is the easiest and is generally assigned to
    elementary students.
*   **Pro/con:** Author lays out two sides of an issue and presents the
    evidence to support each side but doesn’t take a position.
*   **Argumentative:** Author presents the evidence for both sides but also
    decides which position has more merit and defends the one he supports.

---
<!-- PAGE 260 -->
<div align="left">230 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Opinion and pro/con writing assignments constitute a scaffold leading to
the argumentative essay—the most challenging of these three types of writing.
In writing opinion pieces, younger students get practice listing reasons that
support a claim. When crafting body paragraphs of a pro/con essay, students
learn to state opposing positions and present evidence that supports each
one. If they actually agree with one side rather than the other, they get prac tice suspending their own opinions and putting themselves in the shoes of
someone on the other side—a skill that will serve them well when they turn to
argumentative writing and need to summarize an opposing viewpoint fairly.

> **WHY PRACTICE WRITING OPINION, PRO/CON, AND
> ARGUMENTATIVE PIECES?**
>
> *   Develops analytical and logical thinking skills
> *   Helps students distinguish reliable sources from unreliable ones
> *   Improves organizational skills
> *   Teaches students to cite textual evidence effectively
> *   Develops the ability to assess and rank stronger and weaker
>     arguments
> *   Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Planning and outlining before writing a draft of any of these essay types
deepens and reinforces students’ understanding of content. Moreover, as with
other outline strategies, these benefits will accrue whether or not students
create a finished product.

## Sentence-Level Activities:
## Laying the Foundation for
## Arguments

To prepare your students for the challenges of writing argumentative essays,
you can give them sentence-level activities that will introduce some of the
techniques they’ll ultimately use for that type of writing. The conjunction,
transition, and sentence expansion activities that follow will also deepen stu dents’ comprehension of the curriculum content in which they’re embedded
and spur them to think analytically about what they’ve learned.

---
<!-- PAGE 261 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 231</div>

### Using Conjunctions to Present a Position

The following examples illustrate how conjunction activities can introduce
students to the idea of identifying evidence that supports claims.

When students use *because*, they need to find evidence that supports the
proposition given in the sentence stem. When they use *so*, they need to con sider what action people should take as a result of that evidence. As always,
using the conjunction *but* may be more challenging because students need
to come up with opposing evidence—laying the foundation for pro/con, and,
eventually, argumentative writing.

#### Level 1 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> Weather forecasts can be helpful because **people need to prepare for different
> conditions.**
>
> Weather forecasts can be helpful, but **they are not always accurate.**
>
> Weather forecasts can be helpful, so **it is important to check them regularly.**

#### Level 2 Example

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture because
> **they can be engineered to resist pests, tolerate harsh conditions, and
> increase crop yields.**
>
> Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, but **there
> are concerns about their impact on biodiversity, their potential health risks,
> and the ethics of genetic manipulation.**
>
> Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, so **it’s
> important to conduct ongoing research and establish regulations to ensure
> their safe and responsible use.**

---
<!-- PAGE 262 -->
<div align="left">232 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

### Using Transitions to Introduce and
### Support Claims

A transition may begin a sentence, thus creating a link between that sentence
and the one that precedes it, or link thoughts within a sentence. When used
at the beginning or end of a paragraph, transitions can underscore a theme
or idea that knits the paragraph’s various sentences together. And, of course,
transitions can and should be used judiciously to connect the paragraphs in
a multiple-paragraph essay. These functions are explained in more detail in
Chapter 9.

All five categories of transition words and phrases can be helpful in
presenting and evaluating reasons, evidence, and claims (see Appendix C).
Students can learn to use the following types of transitions:

*   **Time-and-sequence** transitions such as *in addition, moreover,* and
    *finally* to list reasons and claims on each side
*   **Illustration** transitions such as *for example* and *specifically* to provide
    examples of a general claim or introduce evidence
*   **Emphasis** transitions such as *most important, moreover,* or *certainly* to
    highlight the most important claims or underscore an argument
*   **Change-of-direction** transitions such as *however, although,* and *in
    contrast* to introduce or acknowledge opposing claims
*   **Conclusion** transitions such as *thus* or *in the end* to signal that they’re
    wrapping up an argument

Change-of-direction transitions are particularly useful for introducing a
contrasting point, example, or argument. They can come in the middle of
sentences, as with *but*, or at the beginning of a new sentence, as with *however*.
When one paragraph is devoted to a claim and the next to a counterclaim,
tell your students they can introduce the second paragraph with a change-of direction transition such as *on the other hand*.

> **RESOURCE**
>
> Transition Words
> and Phrases
> *Appendix C*

---
<!-- PAGE 263 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 233</div>

Another type of change-of-direction transition—the subordinating
conjunction—is particularly useful for thesis statements in pro/con or argu mentative essays. If students begin their thesis statements with words such
as *although* and *while*, they’ll be able to acknowledge two opposing claims.
They’ll also be able to avoid using the first person (*I believe*), which can
detract from the authority of their argument.

### Using Sentence Expansion to Build
### Argumentative Skills

Another sentence-level activity that can be adapted to build argumentative
skills is sentence expansion. Remember that sentence expansion involves
giving students a kernel sentence—a simple, active, declarative sentence with
only one verb—along with the question words to help them expand it. To
make sentence expansion into an argumentative activity, make the kernel
sentence you give students one that takes a position. This example is embed ded in content from the book *Flowers for Algernon*:¹

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence.
>
> His life greatly improved.
>
> Who? **Charlie**
>
> When? **after experimental surgery**
>
> Why? **intelligence ↑**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: After the experimental surgery, Charlie’s life greatly
> improved because his intelligence increased.**

---
<!-- PAGE 264 -->
<div align="left">234 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Then you might also give them a kernel that takes the opposite position.
For example:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence.
>
> His quality of life declined.
>
> Who? **Charlie**
>
> When? **after experimental surgery**
>
> Why? **lost friends → lonely**
>
> **EXPANDED SENTENCE: After the experimental surgery, Charlie’s quality
> of life declined because he lost his friends and became lonely.**

### Using Sentence-Level Activities Together

#### Level 1 Example

Ms. Cole’s second-grade class had been reading about the advantages and
disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos as opposed to their natural habitats.
To help students understand the debate and work on their writing skills,
Ms. Cole gave them sentence stems that required them to supply a logical or
evidence-based reason to support the pro-zoo side and explain what followed
from that position:

> Zoos are good for animals because **they protect endangered species
> from extinction.**
>
> Zoos are good for animals, so **people should continue to support them.**
>
> Since many zoos educate visitors about conservation, **people learn to
> respect the environment.**

---
<!-- PAGE 265 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 235</div>

Then she made the activity more challenging by asking them to consider
arguments on the other side:

> Zoos are not good for animals because **animals should not be
> removed from their native habitats.**
>
> Zoos are not good for animals, so **they should not be supported
> by the public.**
>
> Since many zoos keep animals in unsafe conditions, **animals develop
> health problems.**

Finally, Ms. Cole asked her students to summarize both positions without
taking a side:

> Although some people believe that zoos help certain species survive,
> **others argue that animals should not be held captive.**

Next Ms. Cole wanted her students to practice using transition words
between sentences. Although the students weren’t yet ready to write pro/
con paragraphs about zoos, she wanted them to have experience creating the
kinds of connections between thoughts that they would need to use during
the drafting and revising stages.

Ms. Cole gave her students pairs of sentences that had no transition words
connecting them. The students needed to choose an appropriate transition
word for each pair and write it in the blank. To provide additional support,
Ms. Cole provided a word bank of transition words for her students to choose
from. Initially, she gave them sentences that only required them to take one
side, either pro or con, like this:

> If zoos are closed, many animal species may become extinct.
> **For example,** the numbers of wild gorillas and elephants have
> decreased because of poachers.
>
> Zoos have improved over the years. **As a result,** animals live
> longer in them and are healthier.

---
<!-- PAGE 266 -->
<div align="left">236 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Then she introduced transitions that required students to offer contrasting
evidence, laying the groundwork for pro/con and argumentative writing:

> Some people believe zoos can be good for animals. On the other hand,
> **critics say that animals have better lives in the wild.**

#### Level 2 Example

When his Level 2 history class was studying the presidency of Theodore
Roosevelt, Mr. Hidalgo gave them the following sentence stems to develop
their argumentative writing skills:

> Theodore Roosevelt has many admirers because **he established
> national parks and expanded national forests.**

Mr. Hidalgo then made the activity more challenging by introducing stems
that required students to consider both pro and con considerations, such as
this one:

> Although Theodore Roosevelt moved the United States toward becoming
> a world power, **critics argue that Roosevelt had imperialistic
> tendencies, particularly in his approach to foreign affairs.**

He also had students complete stems in a way that took a position to help
them distinguish between pro/con writing and argumentative writing, and to
prepare them for the latter:

> While critics of Theodore Roosevelt point to his use of military
> interventions and limited action on civil rights, **his accomplishments in
> conservation, foreign affairs, and support of workers’ rights are
> outstanding legacies.**

Mr. Hidalgo had students supply transition words to link sentences about
Roosevelt’s administration. But because his Level 2 students were more experi enced writers, he had them come up with their own transition words rather than
giving them a word bank to choose from:

> Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia.
> **Consequently,** he was criticized for interfering in the internal affairs of
> another country.

---
<!-- PAGE 267 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 237</div>

Alternatively, Mr. Hidalgo could have given students the transition and
had them complete the sentence:

> Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia.
> Consequently, **he was criticized for interfering in the internal
> affairs of another country.**

## Opinion Writing

Opinion writing is the least demanding type of writing in this genre because
students can present one point of view without bringing in arguments on
the other side. For Level 1 writers, an opinion piece can consist of just one
paragraph. However, they must do more than simply state their opinions.
They need to back up their opinions with reasons, although their reasons can
be based on personal experience rather than evidence.

For example, a student might write an opinion piece arguing that dogs
make better pets than cats. She might talk about how loyal, affectionate,
and obedient her own dog is. She wouldn’t need to bring in and evaluate
arguments against dogs (they need to be walked) or in favor of cats (they keep
themselves clean).

### Fact versus Opinion:
### Introducing the Distinction

It’s important for students to develop an understanding of the difference
between opinion and fact because opinions won’t be enough to support their
arguments later on when they’re writing pro/con or argumentative essays.
They’ll need evidence.

You can start introducing students to the fact/opinion distinction in the
early elementary grades. In one of our partner schools, for example, a first grade teacher had her class collectively plan an opinion paragraph explaining
why a lot of children love summer. As they came up with a topic sentence and
details for the body, the teacher listed the latter in note form on a whiteboard.

---
<!-- PAGE 268 -->
<div align="left">238 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Then she guided them through the process of coming up with a concluding
sentence, producing an outline that looked something like this:

> T.S. **A lot of students love summer.**
>
> 1.  **no school or homework**
>
> 2.  **swimming**
>
> 3.  **more time outside**
>
> 4.  **longer days**
>
> C.S. **Summer is the best time of the year!**

During this kind of activity, a teacher can point out that the concluding
sentence is an opinion, and the details on the numbered lines are facts that
support it.

Some topics don’t lend themselves to reasons beyond the author’s personal
experience. If you ask your students to write an opinion piece about what the
best holiday is, they’re probably going to list the reasons *they* like Christmas
or Thanksgiving. To help your students develop the skills that will help them
write argumentative essays, you’ll need to choose topics that lend themselves
to reasoned debate, based on facts. **Your students will need to have factual
information they can draw on to support their opinions.**

## Pro/Con Writing

Level 2 students may be able to *go* straight to pro/con compositions, which are
a significant step up from opinion pieces. Each body paragraph in the essay
presents one side of an issue and the evidence that supports it. A student might
write a pro paragraph explaining that the ambition of Alexander the Great was

---
<!-- PAGE 269 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 239</div>

a positive trait because he brought the benefits of Greek civilization to other
lands. Then the student could write a con paragraph that it was a negative trait
because Alexander’s conquest of foreign lands caused so much suffering.

A pro/con essay has an introduction and a conclusion, but—unlike in an
argumentative essay—students take a neutral stance, simply presenting the
claims and evidence on each side.

### Using Pro or Con SPOs and
### Paragraphs as Stepping Stones

Before asking your students to undertake an entire argumentative essay—
which would raise two points of view and present evidence for and evaluate
each—first give them ample practice planning a single paragraph that
summarizes the arguments for a position on one side, backed by evidence.
Next, they can practice planning another single paragraph that summarizes
the opposing view—again, backed by evidence. These activities will prepare
them to write a pro/con essay that neutrally presents two points of view. The
activities will also equip students for the more challenging task of deciding
which position is stronger and why, which they’ll confront when they write
argumentative essays.

It’s important to include language like “some argue,” and “others say” in a
pro/con essay. If the second half of the sentence just says, “it led him to take
actions that caused a great deal of suffering,” the author is making an argu ment rather than neutrally summarizing claims on both sides—and that kind
of writing belongs in an argumentative essay, not a pro/con one.

### Matching Opposing Topic Sentences
### with Details

A great way to introduce the skill of constructing arguments on two sides is
to provide two SPOs, one pro and one con, that have only the topic sentences
filled in. At the top, provide a list of details, in note form, and ask students
to match each detail to the appropriate topic sentence. As always, when first
introducing students to this activity, model it by guiding the whole class
through it orally.

<!-- PAGE 270 -->
<div align="left">240 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 1 Example

Ms. Cole gave her class the following activity on zoos. One topic sentence took
a pro-zoo position and the other an anti-zoo one. Students had to look at the
list of details provided and copy them onto the appropriate dotted lines.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence.
>
> provide food + water + shelter
>
> captivity → animals distressed
>
> care for injured + abandoned animals
>
> educate visitors/conservation
>
> small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)
>
> no socializing w/ others → bored
>
> protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct
>
> visitors tease animals
>
> T.S. Zoos are harmful to animals and should be abolished.
>
> 1.  **small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)**
>
> 2.  **captivity → animals distressed**

>
> T.S. Zoos provide benefits to both animals and people.

#### Level 2 Example

Mr. Hidalgo gave his history class the following activity about the presidency
of Theodore Roosevelt.

> **DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence.
>
> conservation
>
> not enough progress/civil rts
>

>

>
> 3.  **constructed Panama Canal**
>
> 4.  **consumer rts**

---
<!-- PAGE 272 -->
<div align="left">242 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

By providing details, you’re essentially doing the research for your students
so they can focus on deciding which evidence supports which claim. When
embedded in the content of the curriculum, this activity will also encourage
your students to engage in close reading of texts. They’ll need to think care fully to decide which details from the text go with which topic sentence.

Tell your students they should list the strongest reason or evidence last,
where it will have the most impact on the reader. That means they’ll need to
decide which detail provides the strongest argument in support of each claim.
This practice evaluating the strength of claims will also prepare students for
deciding which position they want to take when it’s time to write argumenta tive essays.

### Creating Pro/Con SPOs from Scratch

Once students have become familiar with matching details to the appropriate
topic sentence and evaluating their strength, they can start creating their own
SPOs. Tell them to write a topic sentence and a concluding sentence for each
paragraph—pro and con—and write supporting details in note form on the
dotted lines of each outline.

#### Level 1 Example

Ms. Cole decided her class was now ready to build on their previous activities
by creating their own SPOs on the subject of zoos—one summarizing the pro
arguments and the other summarizing the opposing view. To do this, they
would need to create topic and concluding sentences.

Since her students were second graders, they hadn’t yet been intro duced to all three strategies for creating effective topic and concluding
sentences—using one of the sentence types, using an appositive, and using a
subordinating conjunction. Ms. Cole had taught them only the first strategy,
using one of the four sentence types: a command, a question, an exclamation,
or a statement. She reminded them of each type before they began filling out
their SPOs.

---
<!-- PAGE 273 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 243</div>

The following are examples of the SPOs students produced:

> T.S. **Zoos benefit animals in many ways.**
>
> 1.  **provide food + water + shelter**
>
> 2.  **care for injured + abandoned animals**
>
> 3.  **protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct**
>
> 4.  **educate visitors/conservation**
>
> C.S. **Zoos keep animals safe and help them survive.**

> T.S. **It is cruel to keep animals in zoos.**
>
> 1.  **small exhibits/little place to roam (e.g., elephants)**
>
> 2.  **captivity → animals distressed**
>
> 3.  **could never survive in the wild**
>
> 4.  **visitors tease animals**
>
> C.S. **Boycott zoos!**

<!-- PAGE 274 -->
<div align="left">244 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

#### Level 2 Example

Mr. Hidalgo also had his history students plan their own pro/con SPOs on
Theodore Roosevelt. He required his students to come up with different topic
sentences than the ones he had supplied for the matching activity, and he
reminded them of the three strategies to create one.

Similarly, he required students to come up with some different details
than the ones he had provided. He reminded them to include the sources
for the details in note form so that they would be able to provide citations or
incorporate quotations from the text if and when they turned their SPOs into
paragraphs.

> T.S. **Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency had shortcomings.**
>
> 1.  **used force to achieve foreign policy**
>
> 2.  **over-regulated business**
>
> 3.  **not enough progress/civil rts**
>
> 4.  **treatment of Nat. Americans**
>
> C.S. **Although Theodore Roosevelt accomplished a great deal, his
> presidency was flawed.**

> C.S. **In conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt left an impressive record of
> accomplishments.**

## TOs and MPOs for Pro/Con
## Compositions

The next phase in developing the skills necessary for the argumentative essay
is to have students create a TO or MPO that considers both sides but doesn’t
take a position. To do that, they can build on their existing pro and con SPOs
or use a new topic.

As we discussed in Chapter 9, the first steps in creating TOs and MPOs are
for you to select a topic and lead the students in developing a thesis statement.
If students are choosing a new topic at this point, make sure that it’s both
debatable and manageable—neither too broad nor too narrow. Ask yourself if
students will be able to handle the amount of evidence or research required.

---
<!-- PAGE 276 -->
<div align="left">246 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

A TO or MPO for a pro/con essay might look something like the ones in
Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2:

<!-- PAGE 278 -->
<div align="left">248 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

As always, the TO and the MPO will differ in what they require of stu dents. In a pro/con TO, students will write thesis and concluding statements
that consist of one sentence acknowledging that there are arguments on both
sides. A thesis statement might be:

> **There are arguments for and against increasing the minimum wage.**

Alternatively, students can construct a thesis or concluding statement for a
pro/con essay that makes use of a subordinating conjunction:

> **Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would
> have a negative impact on many small businesses, others claim
> that an increased wage would be beneficial to many households.**

Remember that if students leave out a phrase like “others claim that,”
they’re constructing a thesis statement for an *argumentative* essay, not a pro/
con essay. A thesis statement for an argumentative essay would read like this:

> **Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would
> have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, an increased
> wage would be beneficial to many households.**

This thesis statement signals that the author has considered the evidence
on both sides, has come to a conclusion about which side makes more sense,
and is prepared to defend that conclusion with evidence. You can introduce
your students to the distinction between pro/con and argumentative thesis
statements at this point, but if they haven’t had sufficient practice with pro/
con essays, they may not be ready to move on to argumentative writing.

If students are developing an MPO rather than a TO, they’ll need to construct
a thesis statement but not a concluding statement. When they write their draft,
they’ll create general and specific statements for their introductory and conclud ing paragraphs, along with a reworded thesis statement to use in the latter.

## The Argumentative Essay

An argumentative essay has to be both persuasive and fair. Students will need
to convince the reader that their own position is the stronger one but, at the
same time, present the opposing point of view accurately. Their experience
writing neutral pro/con essays will help them with the latter task.

---
<!-- PAGE 279 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 249</div>

Composing argumentative essays will enhance skills that your students
will generally find useful in later life, in the workplace, and personally.

**Of all the writing genres, argumentative writing will be the most effec tive at sharpening students’ analytical faculties. Learning to construct and
defend an argument will enable them to think logically and critically.**

### Using an MPO to Plan an
### Argumentative Essay

Before your students can start creating an MPO for an argumentative essay,
they have to decide which position they’re taking. To do that, they’ll need to
understand the facts and evidence on both sides. Be sure that the class has
spent ample time studying and discussing the topic first.

Students need to know that when creating a thesis statement for an argu mentative essay, they should put the argument they’re making last. For exam ple, if a student wants to argue that the Industrial Revolution was essentially a
positive development, they would *not* write:

> Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, its drawbacks
> cannot be ignored.

Instead, they would end the sentence with the point that the Industrial
Revolution brought benefits, as in this sentence:

> Although the Industrial Revolution had its drawbacks, the many benefits
> it brought cannot be ignored.

In addition to the introductory and concluding paragraphs—which will
use the GST and TSG structures—the essay will have three or more body
paragraphs (see Exhibit 10.3).

*   **1st paragraph.** Introduction GST
*   **2nd paragraph.** Lays out the background of the issue accurately, but
    presents evidence in a way that tends to support the author’s position.
*   **3rd paragraph.** Presents the counterclaim and the evidence to support it.
*   **4th paragraph.** Provides the strongest evidence for the author’s point
    of view.
*   **5th paragraph.** Conclusion TSG

The standard argumentative essay often consists of five or more para graphs, although this is not always a requirement. However, when your
students begin to write these essays, you may decide to limit them to four
paragraphs. They will omit the paragraph right after the introduction that lays
out the problem and introduces their own argument. Instead they’ll have only
two body paragraphs: the first presenting the counterclaim and evidence and
the second presenting their own claim and evidence.

**Students should not attempt to raise a claim and rebut it in the same
paragraph.** In our experience, that approach often leads to a fragmented and
confusing presentation of the information.

### Incorporating Evidence and Quotations

Since students are unlikely to be experts in the topics they’re writing about,
they’ll need to introduce citations, paraphrases, and quotations. Although
they should cite authorities supporting both sides, they’ll need to show why
those who support their own side are more convincing.

At the MPO stage, your students won’t actually be incorporating complete
citations and quotations, but they will be making notations on their outlines
referring to them. Later, they’ll integrate that evidence as footnotes and refer ences when they convert their MPOs into drafts and final copies. To prepare
your students for that task, have them practice introducing quotations and
other evidence in a way that supports a claim (see Chapter 9).

Certain words are particularly well suited to framing quotations or para phrases in argumentative writing. When introducing a quotation or summary
that supports their claim, students should characterize the source in a way
that indicates its authority and uses stronger verbs than *says* or even *believes*
to introduce the statement. More powerful verbs include *endorses, asserts,
emphasizes, reminds us,* and *affirms*.

For example, a student seeking authority in arguing against harsh forms of
juvenile justice could simply write the following:

> Professor Clarke said, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be
> ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.”

---
<!-- PAGE 282 -->

Think how much more mileage the student could get out of that quotation
by framing it with an appositive that indicates the speaker’s authority and
using a verb that links the speaker’s ideas to the student’s own point
of views, such as:

> Professor Clarke, a nationally recognized expert on juvenile justice
> reform, endorses this view when she writes, “Programs like boot
> camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile
> delinquency.”

Illustration transitions are also effective ways to introduce textual evidence
and quotations, as shown here:

> Experts in the field of juvenile justice reform agree that harsh
> measures don’t work. **For example,** Professor Clarke has written
> that boot camps “have been shown to be ineffective in preventing
> juvenile delinquency.”

#### Level 2 Example

Mr. Hidalgo felt that his students were now ready not only to summarize the
arguments on both sides of the debate, but also to take a position and eval uate claims on the other side. He asked his students to think carefully about
the arguments on each side and then choose the position they personally felt
was stronger. Their next task was to craft a thesis statement that stated their
position and acknowledged a counterclaim.

He also wanted his students to start citing sources for their evidence
and quotations, so he told them to be sure to note them on the details
lines of their MPOs. Exhibit 10.4 shows the MPO that one of his students
produced.

### Differentiating Argumentative Assignments

Level 1 students are not yet experienced enough to plan and write argumen tative essays. Therefore, they should keep practicing opinion and pro/con
pieces until they’ve developed the skills necessary for tasks like writing gen eral, specific, and thesis statements; engaging in research; and distinguishing
between stronger and weaker arguments.

However, you may be teaching a class where some Level 2 students are
ready to plan argumentative essays using the MPO and others should instead
use the TO. Those using the TO will not need to create general and specific
statements, and they may not dive as deeply into the evidence, but they will
be acquiring skills that will enable them to write more fully fleshed-out argu mentative essays in the future.

## Argumentative Terms

As students move to more sophisticated expository and argumentative
writing, consider giving them lists of words that are geared to those types of
writing. For example, topic sentences using words such as *although* or *while*
work particularly well for both pro/con and argumentative writing.

This would be a good point to introduce your students to words that will
come in handy in presenting arguments that are made by others. For exam ple, they can describe those on one side as *proponents* and those on the other
as *naysayers*. Instead of simply using the verb *said*, they can use verbs such as
*argue* and *maintain*.

**EXAMPLES:**

> Defenders of Theodore Roosevelt argue….
>
> Critics of Theodore Roosevelt assert….

<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 255</div>

## Review: Argumentative
## Writing Activities

If you’re a middle or high school teacher, the following scaffolds will help
you guide your students through the activities that lead to the crafting of an
argumentative essay. These activities will enable students to organize their
material more effectively, think more analytically, and write more coherently
as they prepare to tackle argumentative assignments.

If you’re an elementary teacher, your students are probably not yet ready
to create argumentative essays. However, if you use the activities leading up
to pro/con essays, you’ll be laying the foundation for their ability to write
argumentative essays at higher grade levels.

**SENTENCE-LEVEL STRATEGIES**

*   Use *because-but-so* activities to present students with a sentence stem
    that takes a position and have them:
    *   Connect a claim to evidence (*because*), introduce a counterclaim
        (*but*), and describe cause/effect relationships (*so*).
*   Use subordinating conjunctions (*while, although,* and *even though*) to
    write sentences that acknowledge a counterclaim and state a claim.
*   Use sentence-expansion activities to present students with a kernel
    sentence that takes a position.
*   Use transition activities to present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and
    claims.

---
<!-- PAGE 287 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 10 | Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays 257</div>

**SINGLE-PARAGRAPH OUTLINE**

*   Practice writing topic sentences for paragraphs that summarize a position
    on one side of an issue, using the three strategies for creating them:
    *   Sentence type (a statement expressing the position of advocates)
    *   Subordinating conjunction
    *   Appositive
*   Match topic sentences taking opposing positions with appropriate
    details.
*   Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes a position, backed
    by evidence.
*   Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes an opposing view,
    also backed by evidence.

**TO AND MPO: PRO/CON**

*   Practice writing a pro/con thesis statement that presents two sides
    of an argument without taking a position for a TO (e.g., “Although
    there are many who argue that an extended school year will benefit
    students, opponents believe that additional time will not produce
    meaningful results”).
*   Write a complete pro/con TO or MPO that presents the evidence for
    two sides of an argument without taking a position.

**MPO: ARGUMENT (FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL
LEVEL 2 STUDENTS)**

*Some students in a class might be ready for the argumentative essay but not
yet ready for the MPO, in which case they should use the TO.*

*   Practice writing an argumentative thesis statement that presents
    two sides of an argument and takes a position, placing the author’s
    position at the end of the thesis statement (e.g., “Although extending
    the school year has many drawbacks, its benefits outweigh them”).

---
<!-- PAGE 288 -->
<div align="left">258 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

*   Develop a four- or five-paragraph MPO that lays out two sides of an
    argument and takes a position.
    *   **1st paragraph.** Introduction: Write only “GST” in the Details box.
        The thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence on
        the solid line above the outline.
    *   **2nd paragraph.** Lay out the background of the issue accurately,
        but in a way that tends to support the author’s position. (When
        students are first being introduced to the argumentative MPO,
        they may omit this paragraph.)
    *   **3rd paragraph.** Present the counterclaim and the evidence to
        support it.
    *   **4th paragraph.** Provide the strongest evidence for the author’s
        point of view.
    *   **5th paragraph.** Conclusion: Write only “TSG.”

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

*   Generate general and specific statements.
*   Practice using transition words and phrases to present and evaluate
    reasons and claims:
    *   Time and sequence: List reasons and claims on each side.
    *   Illustration: Provide examples of a general claim or introduce
        evidence.
    *   Emphasis: Highlight important claims or underscore an argument.
    *   Change of direction: Introduce or acknowledge opposing claims.
    *   Conclusion: Signal wrapping up an argument.
*   Practice activities that introduce and explain a quotation in a way that
    supports a claim.

we went on in 3rd grade. We had to behove in school to
go on it. On board we got to power a vacum with a
bicycle. I’ve always wanted to try that. Although, I didn’t
get to ride if I was happy for my friends that
did. In the area with the bicycle there was
a goose with eggs! In order to keep the eggs warm
she picked out some of her feathers And moved it around.
Also she would get up and turn to look somewhere else
And when she did you could see the tiny eggs
underneath her. At the end of the trip we got to plant
plants. First, we put dirt made of coconut husk into a
mixture of salt and sand (spun very fast) with the
plant inside into the dirt. The salt and sand help water
for the plant! We had to mix plant food with water
and give that to the plant because the soil we gave
it doesn’t have the putrients it needs to srvile.
In conclusion this is why I like the trip to the
science barge the most.

## Using Writing to
## Monitor Learning

The strategies and activities you have read about in this book teach students
writing skills and guide them to acquire knowledge on a daily basis. As you
have probably noticed, they also have great value in revealing how much
students are learning, not only about writing skills, but also about the mate rial they are studying. In other words, these activities serve as **formative
assessments**. They will help you to monitor your students’ comprehension
of material that has been taught, determine your next instructional steps,

---
<!-- PAGE 296 -->
<div align="left">266 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

and enable you to provide explicit, effective feedback that will move stu dents forward.

In many schools, particularly at the elementary level, students’ progress
in literacy is measured by periodic “benchmark” assessments designed to
evaluate general comprehension skills like “finding the main idea” of a text.
Studies have found that such tests are highly unreliable. In one study, about a
thousand children took four different standardized measures of comprehen sion. Researchers found that the odds of any two tests identifying the same
student as a poor reader or a high-achieving one were less than half.¹

And because the reading passages on the tests are unrelated to topics in
the curriculum, the tests also don’t even attempt to assess what students have
learned about any content they may have been taught. Writing activities like
those described in this book can be a far more reliable and accurate measure
of learning—for students, their parents, and their teachers.

Formative assessments have other advantages as well. When students
get prompt and regular feedback, they have a clearer sense of what they’ve
accomplished and what they still need to work on.

In addition, research has shown that when formative assessment is done
frequently, it’s one of the most effective ways to enable students to transfer
information to long-term memory—a key step in learning.²

Here is an example of formative assessment if your class has read *Night*.³

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.
>
> The prisoners are forced on a death march because **they have to evacuate
> the concentration camp.**
>
> The prisoners are forced on a death march, but **Eliezer manages to survive.**
>
> The prisoners are forced on a death march, so **most die from fatigue, disease,
> and the bitter cold weather.**

---
<!-- PAGE 297 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 11 | A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students’ Writing 267</div>

**Summative assessments**, which occur at the end of a unit of study,
measure what learning students have gained over a period of time—at least
in theory. When standardized state reading tests are used as summative
assessments, they rarely serve that purpose. They usually do not measure the
writing skills you have taught, and, as with standardized benchmark assess ments, the content of the passages is unlikely to align to the content of the
curriculum you’re using. In any event, the results are generally not available
until months after the tests have been administered. It makes far more sense
to use summative assessments, including those that require written responses,
grounded in content that has actually been taught.

## Periodic Assessments to Monitor
## Writing Progress

In addition to using TWR activities to monitor your students’ progress in
learning content you have taught, you should also give periodic assessments
specifically aimed at measuring their progress in acquiring writing skills.

For these kinds of assessments, provide prompts on generic topics that
give you a sense of where your students are in relation to each other, what
their general strengths and weaknesses are, and what your goals for writing
instruction should be.

At the beginning, middle, and end of the school year, it’s important to assess:

*   What skills have been transferred to independent writing
*   What skills your students need to acquire

You should give your students a simple prompt without providing
guidance or assistance. Be sure the topic is one that your students know
well enough to write about coherently. All your students should have the
same prompt so that it will be easier for you to analyze their strengths and
weaknesses.

---
<!-- PAGE 298 -->
<div align="left">268 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

A prompt can consist of a single word or a brief phrase. Some prompts we
have found to be useful are:

> Friends (or friendship or how to make/keep friends)
>
> Hopes for the future
>
> Role model
>
> Special gift or possession
>
> Personal goals
>
> Favorite season
>
> Favorite pastime
>
> Why do we study the past?\*

\*For older students.

One of the skills you are evaluating is a student’s ability to write a topic
sentence, so avoid prompts that provide a “sentence starter.” If the prompt
is “a great school trip,” for example, many students will start the assignment
with those four words. Simple phrases such as “school trip” or “role model”
make better prompts.

Alternatively, you can provide more explanation. For example, rather than
simply asking students to write about “a role model,” you could give them the
following paragraph:

> A role model is someone you admire for having qualities you would like to
> have. A role model is a person whose behavior or achievements you respect.
> Think about someone you consider a role model, and write about why that
> person is special to you. You may choose someone you know or someone you
> have read about. You may choose someone who is alive today or someone
> who is no longer here but has made a lasting impression on you.

Another word of caution: try to avoid prompts that are apt to yield lists,
such as “winning the lottery” or “my favorite things.”

Many other subjects could work well as prompts, and you, as the teacher, are
the best judge of what your particular students are likely to be able to write about.

---
<!-- PAGE 299 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 11 | A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students’ Writing 269</div>

You may not want to use the same prompt for all three writing assessments
at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. However, it can provide
a clearer basis for comparison if you stay with the same general topic. For
example:

> **Beginning of the year:**
> Write a paragraph about the best or more interesting parts of [previous
> grade level]. Describe at least two.
>
> **Middle of the year:**
> Write a paragraph about which subject is your favorite and why. Give two
> or three reasons.
>
> **End of the year:**
> Write a paragraph about the best or most interesting parts of [ending
> grade level]. Describe at least two.

### How to Administer Beginning-, Middle-, and
### End-of-Year Writing Assessments

When you are administering the assessment, the first step is to **explain the
purpose of the activity**. Let your students know that the assessment will help
you understand where they need help to further develop their writing skills.
Remind them to do their best work so you’ll be able to see what they already
know how to do and what they still need help with.

To get an accurate picture of what students can do independently, try
not to give them any help during the assessment. If a student has difficulty
spelling a word, for example, ask him to make his best guess and provide
the correct spelling only if he’s unable to continue. If a student just can’t get
started, you might have to provide her with a general suggestion or a topic
sentence. **If you do need to provide students with help, be sure to note on
the assessment exactly what was done with teacher support.**

**Your instructions must be explicit.** First, make it clear that students
should keep their writing samples brief. If you’re teaching first graders, you
may want to tell them that it’s fine to write just a sentence or two. Even with

---
<!-- PAGE 300 -->
<div align="left">270 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

older Level 1 and some Level 2 students, it’s best to limit the samples to a
single paragraph. You’ll be asking them to revise and edit their work later, and
that may feel overwhelming if they’ve written at length.

**If students have learned how to develop an SPO, be sure to remind them
to complete one before writing so that you can assess their outlining skills.**
If Level 2 students have been taught to develop Multiple-Paragraph Outlines
(TOs and MPOs), you might allow them to write up to three paragraphs—
after completing an outline, of course. Be sure that students’ outlines are
attached to their writing samples.

Typically, these assessments will take no more than one class period to
complete, but some students may take less time. **Return the assessment
samples to students in the next day or two and ask them to revise and edit
their work.** Tell them that the best writers often find ways to improve and
correct their work and that it’s important for you to see what they would like
to change in their writing.

**It’s not necessary to have students make final copies of the assessment,
unless the revised and edited version is illegible.**

When the allotted time for revision and editing is up, collect the students’
samples and date them. After assessing a student’s work, put it in a dedicated
folder so you can monitor individual progress.

### How to Evaluate Beginning-, Middle-, and
### End-of-Year Writing Assessments

As we noted in Chapter 6, the following four criteria are generally used to
assess writing quality.

**STRUCTURE**

*   Are the sentences in the paragraph, or the paragraphs in a longer
    composition, arranged appropriately?

---
<!-- PAGE 301 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 11 | A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students’ Writing 271</div>

**COHERENCE**

*   Are the sentences (and paragraphs) logically related to one another?

**UNITY**

*   Does every sentence support the main idea of the paragraph?
*   Does every paragraph support the main idea of the composition?

**WELL-CONSTRUCTED SENTENCES**

*   Are the sentences grammatically correct and clear?
*   Are there compound and complex sentences in addition to simple,
    active ones?
*   Do the sentences begin in a variety of ways?

Judging the quality of student writing may be one of the most difficult
tasks in all of educational assessment. Some aspects of writing are easy to
quantify—total number of words or sentences, sentence length, spelling, or
proper grammar and usage—but others are highly subjective.

Even experts have disagreed on the best way to go about measuring
writing quality. “Over the years,” one team of experts has written, “writing
assessment research and practice has suffered from dissension at every point,
on almost every feature of stimulating, producing, evaluating, and teaching
writing.”⁴

Several factors can interfere with the accuracy of writing assessments:

*   **Decoding.** When students are asked to write in response to a written
    prompt, some may have difficulty decoding it.
*   **Background information.** Lack of knowledge about the topic causes
    some students to have trouble understanding the prompt and/or
    producing a response.
*   **Computers.** If students write their responses on computers, those
    who are comfortable using computers will have an advantage over
    those who aren’t.

---
<!-- PAGE 302 -->
<div align="left">272 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

*   **Mechanical errors.** There are questions about how much weight to
    give to errors in capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and grammar.
    Although students need to master these aspects of writing, technical
    mistakes can be distracting and lead teachers to overlook the progress
    students may have made in organizing their ideas or using complex
    sentence structures.
*   **Handwriting.** Poor handwriting often has a negative influence on the
    evaluator. We’ll address the subject of handwriting in more detail later
    in this chapter.

The **Writing Assessment Checklists** (Appendix F) can’t entirely eliminate
the difficulties involved in evaluating writing, but they can provide guide lines for more accurate judgments, grounded in strategies you have taught.
They will tell you where each student stands and can be filled out fairly
quickly.

### Comparative Judgment: Another Way of
### Assessing Writing Quality

An interesting approach to evaluating writing offers hope that the task will
become easier. This method, offered through a British organization called
No More Marking, is both more efficient and more reliable than standard
methods. The method, called **comparative judgment**, involves having readers
compare two pieces of student writing and decide which one is better. Studies
have shown that when many such gut-level comparisons are aggregated, the
judgments are highly consistent.⁶

At TWR partner schools, teachers may use comparative judgment to assess
writing progress. Usually the judging is done within a single grade level by
teachers of that grade. Student names are not visible, and judging can be done
anonymously.

---
<!-- PAGE 304 -->
<div align="left">274 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

After judging the writing samples, teachers discuss trends they are noticing
across the grade, which informs their next steps for instruction. For example,
if teachers notice that many students are not beginning their paragraphs with
topic sentences, they can practice using the SPO and the scaffolding activities
as a whole class to reinforce this skill.

Since assessment using comparative judgment takes far less time than
other methods of evaluating student writing, teachers have the opportunity to
see the writing of a broader range of students than is typical with other rating
methods, enabling them to gain perspective that is both deeper and wider on
strengths and areas that need improvement.

No More Marking provides lots of valuable data about how students are
doing. Once teachers have that data, the Hochman Method provides the
specific strategies that teachers can use to address the weaknesses in student
writing that it identifies.

## Having Students Write in Response to
## What They’ve Read

Many teachers have their students write in response to a specific passage
rather than the general prompts we have recommended. There are some
benefits, but also potential pitfalls to this approach.

### The Pros and the Cons

Having students write about a passage they’re given simulates more closely
the kind of writing students will be asked to do on state assessments toward
the end of the school year. Generally, state literacy tests give students a
passage to read and ask them to write in response to it, citing evidence
from the text. The tests may also ask students to read two different texts and
compare them.

It’s important to understand that using texts as a basis for writing assess ments brings its own potential problems. Students may have trouble decoding
the texts, or they may lack the background knowledge that would enable

---
<!-- PAGE 305 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 11 | A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students’ Writing 275</div>

them to understand them—especially if the texts don’t relate to content cov ered in the curriculum. If that’s the case, the assessment will not be accurately
measuring your students’ writing skills.

### Handwriting Matters

One significant problem as students draft and revise their paragraphs
and compositions or take tests is the poor quality of their handwriting.
Although research hasn't established that using cursive confers cognitive
benefits, it’s clear there are other reasons to teach students how to use it.
Good handwriting—including well-formed cursive—can influence a reader’s
evaluation of the quality of a piece of writing. In addition, students who
have never learned or don’t use cursive are often unable to read documents,
letters, and notes written in cursive. This can prove to be a disadvantage in
reading certain text and in communicating with others.⁷

Studies do indicate that it’s important for children to have handwriting
instruction of some kind as opposed to only learning to touch type on a
computer. When students engage in the physical activity of carefully shaping
letters, it increases their ability to recognize letters, promotes their recall of
words, and improves their spelling accuracy.⁸

Many schools no longer focus on handwriting instruction, whether
cursive or printing. That has led to random acts of capitalization as well
as to the failure on the part of many students to leave enough space between
words.

## Maintaining Student Portfolios

It’s a good idea to keep a folder or portfolio of samples of each student’s work
and assessments throughout the year. This collection of a student’s writing can
provide a dramatic reminder of the progress a student has made—progress
that otherwise might be overlooked. It also provides valuable information for
the teacher who has the student the following year.

### CHAPTER 12
# Revolutionizing
# Learning
## Embedding Writing Activities into Content

Throughout this book we’ve given you reminders that unless you’re intro ducing a new TWR strategy, writing activities and assignments should be
embedded in the content you’re teaching. If you’re teaching about the Aztec
Empire, for example, your writing activities, including sentence-level work,
should be about the Aztec Empire. When you adapt TWR strategies to your
particular content, you will be drawing on and reinforcing knowledge of the
material your students have been reading and discussing.

It’s also far more effective to weave writing into regular instruction and
embed it in curricular content than to teach it in a separate writing block.
Rather than having to transfer skills they’ve acquired while writing about
something that has nothing to do with the curriculum—a transfer that often
doesn’t happen—your students will be developing skills and content knowl edge simultaneously. **Writing isn’t just a skill. Writing instruction can also
be a powerful tool for teaching content.**

Keep in mind that the **content** of TWR activities is what drives their rigor:
the same strategy can challenge students at different grade levels, depending
on the content. For example, if you’ve been teaching kindergarteners about
butterflies, you might have them do a *because-but-so* activity orally on cater pillars and cocoons. If you’re teaching an AP American History class, you can
also give your high school students a *because-but-so* activity—but you’ll have

---
<!-- PAGE 310 -->
<div align="left">280 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

them do it in written form and focus on the effectiveness of the New Deal.
The format of the exercise is the same, but the latter activity is obviously far
more rigorous.

Similarly, the principles of organizing and planning Single-Paragraph
Outlines (SPOs), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines
(MPOs) don’t differ significantly from one grade level or ability level to another.
It’s the content that makes the task more challenging.

## Using Strategies Concurrently

One way to have students keep practicing strategies you’ve already taught is
to bring in several different strategies while teaching a single book or topic.
This is, in fact, the optimal way to use the strategies once your students have
become familiar with several of them.

The following examples illustrate how to use this approach with Level 1
and Level 2 students. In both cases, the strategies help students develop their
writing or prewriting skills while simultaneously deepening their understand ing of content.

### Level 1 Examples

If your class has read *Henry’s Freedom Box,¹* consider the following activity:

> Henry didn’t know his birthday because **no one kept records of enslaved people’s
> birthdays.**
>
> Henry got married and had three children, but **his family was separated and sold.**
>
> Henry survived his journey in the small crate for 27 hours. As a result, **he arrived
> in Philadelphia where he finally could be free.**

---
<!-- PAGE 311 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 12 | Revolutionizing Learning: Embedding Writing Activities into Content 281</div>

You could also have students develop a Single-Paragraph Outline:

> T.S. **Henry’s Freedom Box, a true story, has won many awards.**
>
> 1.  **Richmond VA / sep from mother/ worked in factory**
>
> 2.  **marries → 3 children / family sold**
>
> 3.  **mails himself in small crate / 27 hrs.**
>
> 4.  **in Philadelphia Henry a free man**
>
> C.S. **Henry was brave and determined in spite of terrible struggles.**

### Level 2 Examples

If your class has been studying Sumer, Babylon, and Hammurabi, you might
give them the following *because-but-so* activity—shown with possible student
responses:

> Hammurabi created a written code of laws because **he wanted to impose order
> on Babylon.**
>
> Hammurabi created a written code of laws, but **many Babylonians couldn’t
> read them.**
>
> Hammurabi created a written code of laws, so **there was a decrease in crime.**

---
<!-- PAGE 312 -->
<div align="left">282 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

You could also have students develop test questions about the content
using expository terms:

> 1.  **Explain the purpose of a written code of laws.**
>
> 2.  **Enumerate the reasons for creating a code of laws.**
>
> 3.  **Describe how social class influenced punishments.**

Next, you could give your students sentence stems beginning with subor dinating conjunctions and have them develop complete sentences, as in the
following examples:

> If Hammurabi had not developed a written code of laws, **he would have failed to
> unite Babylonia.**
>
> Although Sumer’s city-states were defeated, **the Babylonian Empire adopted
> many of their ideas and practices.**

If students have been introduced to SPOs, have them complete an SPO.
More able students can go on to convert the outline into a paragraph.

> T.S. **Sumer, an ancient Mesopotamian civilization, is lauded for the lasting
> impact of its innovations.**
>
> 1.  **cuneiform = system of writing/maps & sci info**
>
> 2.  **# system → basis today for measuring time**
>
> 3.  **architectural structures (arches, columns, ramps)**
>
> 4.  **written code of laws**
>
> C.S. **The contributions of Sumer had a major influence on later civilizations.**

## Using TWR Strategies to
## “Revolutionize” Your Materials

Most textbooks and other instructional materials provide end-of-chapter
or end-of-unit comprehension questions that don’t reflect TWR strategies.
Usually, you’ll be able to draw on your knowledge of TWR’s method to make
those activities more powerful and reinforce the writing instruction you’ve
been providing. Here are some Level 1 and 2 examples.

### Level 1 Examples

If your class has read *The Cricket in Times Square,*² they may have been asked
to complete an activity like this one:

**Original Activity**

> **DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.
>
> 1.  Why was Chester worried about being in New York City? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
> 2.  What did Tucker do to make him feel better? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

_
> 3.  Where did Tucker take Chester? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---
<!-- PAGE 314 -->
<div align="left">284 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized
activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the sentences using *because, but,* and *so*.
>
> Chester was worried about being in New York City because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Chester was worried about being in New York City, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> Chester was worried about being in New York City, so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your class has been learning about rainforest animals and plants, they
may have been asked to complete an activity like this one:

**Original Activity**

<!-- Image of a graphic organizer with a central box and four connected ovals.
Central box: "Describe the relationship between rainforest animals and plants and explain why the relationship is important."
Ovals: "Example 1", "Example 2", "Example 3", "Example 4" -->

---
<!-- PAGE 315 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 12 | Revolutionizing Learning: Embedding Writing Activities into Content 285</div>

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized
activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

> **DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic
> sentence.
>
> T.S. **Rainforest animals and plants interact in many ways that are important
> for maintaining a balanced ecosystem.**
>
> 1.  ................................................................................................................................
>
> 2.  ................................................................................................................................
>
> 3.  ................................................................................................................................
>
> 4.  ................................................................................................................................

### Level 2 Example

After studying different types of subatomic particles, students were asked the
following questions:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.
>
> 1.  What types of subatomic particles does an atom contain? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 2.  Why are electrons attracted to positive objects? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 3.  How do protons behave? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 4.  What does neutral mean? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---
<!-- PAGE 316 -->
<div align="left">286 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

The teacher “revolutionized” the questions in the following way:

> **DIRECTIONS:** Complete the second sentence following the transition word.
>
> 1.  An atom contains three types of subatomic particles. Specifically, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 2.  Electrons have a negative charge. As a result, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 3.  Protons repel each other. However, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> 4.  The neutron is neutral. In other words, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## How to Use TWR to
## Differentiate Your Instruction

Most classrooms encompass a range of student ability—sometimes a wide
range. One of the most challenging aspects of teaching is accommodating all
of those levels without going over some students’ heads while boring others.

### Keep an Eye Out for Struggling Students

As we’ve demonstrated throughout this book, TWR activities easily lend
themselves to differentiation. It’s not necessary to come up with a completely
different version of the activities or use different content for students of
varying abilities—in fact, that approach risks leaving struggling students
permanently behind. What’s important is that you have a clear idea of what
students are supposed to be learning and activities that will give you a good
sense of whether all students have mastered it.³

---
<!-- PAGE 317 -->
<div align="right">Chapter 12 | Revolutionizing Learning: Embedding Writing Activities into Content 287</div>

### Modify the Same Strategy for Students
### at Different Levels

We’ve described throughout this book how you can differentiate many of the
strategies as we’ve introduced them. But to recap, here are some examples:

*   **Sentence expansion.** Ask fewer question words of students who are
    having difficulty. For example, give all students a kernel such as “They
    rebelled,” but ask some students *who, when, why,* and *where* while
    asking others only *who* and *when*.
*   **Because-but-so.** Give all students the same stem—for example, “The
    British invaded the colonies”—but ask some students to provide
    complete sentences for all three conjunctions while asking others to
    write a sentence for only one or two conjunctions.
*   **Appositives.** Ask all students to supply an appositive to describe a
    person, place, or thing, but give some students a list of words and
    phrases to choose from.
*   **Sentence-combining.** Give all students a group of short sentences to
    combine into one longer one, but provide some students with fewer
    sentences to combine.
*   **Unelaborated paragraph revision.** Give all students the same bare bones paragraph, but give some students fewer instructions on how to
    revise it. For example, you might give some students a list of six things to
    do and limit others to only one or two, such as “Improve T.S. and C.S.”
*   **SPOs.** Have all students complete an SPO, but provide some students
    with the topic or the concluding sentence while asking others to come
    up with those sentences independently. You might also require some
    students to use only key words and phrases for their notes on the
    dotted lines, while others use abbreviations and symbols as well.
*   **TOs or MPOs.** Have all students complete a TO or MPO, but provide
    some students with the categories they’ll need to organize their
    paragraphs while having others come up with their own categories.
*   **MPOs.** When students are converting an MPO into a draft, you can
    also provide some students with the general or specific statements to
    include in their introduction and conclusion.

<div align="left">288 The Writing Revolution 2.0</div>

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   By weaving TWR activities into regular instruction and embedding them in
>     curricular content, you’ll be able to use writing instruction as a powerful
>     teaching tool.
> *   Use several strategies concurrently while teaching any topic.
> *   Differentiate TWR activities for students who are struggling or are racing ahead,
>     without altering the basic form of the activity or using different content.
> *   Transform open-ended questions in your instructional materials into more
>     focused activities using strategies from The Writing Revolution.

### BOOK DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1.  Choose a topic (e.g., a science topic, book chapter, current event) and devise
    activities on that topic for your grade level using: *because, but,* and *so*; sentence
    expansion; subordinating conjunctions; and an SPO, TO, or MPO.
2.  Why do the TWR strategies assess student comprehension more accurately than
    typical end-of-unit textbook questions?

### CHAPTER 13
# Putting the Method
# into Practice
## Leave No Strategy Behind

Throughout this book, we present TWR strategies in a linear fashion. But in
practice, you should **not** aim to get all students to master a particular strategy
and then move on, leaving that strategy behind. Since content and writing
skills are so interconnected, “mastery” will depend as much on the content
you’re teaching as on any particular strategy. In addition, bringing back
strategies you’ve already covered will help remind students to use them in
their writing.

As a result, it’s best to keep moving through your curricular sequence,
continuously bringing previously taught strategies into your instruction and
using them alongside others that you’re introducing. As you move along, you
can always modify strategies for students who are struggling.

## Laying a Strong Foundation:
## Sentence-Level Activities

As we pointed out in Chapter 2, sentences are the foundation for all writing.
If students haven’t learned to write a clear, coherent sentence, they’ll never be
able to write a clear, coherent paragraph or essay. And sentence-level activi ties can be just as challenging for students as lengthier writing assignments—
sometimes even more challenging. Whether students are writing a sentence,
paragraph, or composition, the content drives the rigor.

All students, regardless of their grade or ability level, need to practice craft ing various kinds of sentences. Throughout this book, you’ve seen multiple
examples of TWR sentence activities for all levels and in all subjects.

If you’re teaching beginning writers, English language learners, students
with learning disabilities, or the many students who write the way they speak,
the first step is to make sure they understand what a sentence is. As we noted
in Chapter 1, simply getting them to repeat an abstract definition, such as
“a sentence has a subject and predicate and expressses a complete thought,”
is unlikely to be enough. They will need ample practice in distinguishing
between complete sentences and fragments—and turning fragments into
complete sentences. They’ll also need practice in correcting run-on sentences.

Even if your students are more proficient writers, it is still important to
introduce them to the whole range of TWR sentence strategies. The differ ence is that your pace can be faster. Level 2 students can do much of their
sentence-level work in the context of expanding unelaborated paragraphs and
improving their own writing in response to your specific feedback as they
draft, revise, and edit. These students will also benefit from sentence activities
used as comprehension checks on tests, quizzes, and exit slips.

Generally, all students, regardless of grade level, should practice at least
some sentence activities daily, orally and in writing, whether through the
kinds of checks we just listed or through do-now activities, stop-and-jots,
turn-and-talks, or homework. When students are ready to develop outlines,
continue to include regular practice with sentences in your lessons. As
students start converting their outlines into drafts, they will need to use what
they’ve learned from the sentence activities as tools for revision.

## Breaking Down the
## Writing Process

To make writing manageable for your students, break down the process into
four basic steps—outlining, drafting, revising and editing, and final copy—as
shown here.

1.  Outlining ★
2.  Drafting
3.  Revising/editing ★
4.  Final copy

Most instructional time should be spent on Steps 1 and 3 (hence the red
stars), outlining and revising and editing the draft. Lessons can end after
Steps 1 or 3—but not after Step 2.

**Always have your students revise and edit a draft, whether or not they go
on to turn it into a final copy.**

The outlining and revising/editing stages need to be broken down into a
number of smaller components—first in the context of paragraphs, and later
in the context of compositions.

Don’t skip any of the scaffolding steps; just speed up your rate for more
proficient students. Make sure that all students have had practice identify ing and constructing topic sentences before you ask them to create one for
an SPO.

It’s important to provide your students with plenty of demonstrations
and practice to get them to the point where they’ll be able to craft varied
sentences; outline and write cohesive, coherent paragraphs and compositions;
and revise their writing effectively. You may be tempted to let your students
just plunge into a piece of writing without going through all these steps. After
all, don’t experienced writers do that? The answer is that some do and many
don’t. Especially for more analytical and longer forms of writing—books, for
example—many accomplished writers find outlining to be essential, and **all**
professional writers take time to revise.

Beyond that, experienced, competent writers are able to juggle numerous
factors simultaneously so that composing becomes a recursive process. They
may fine-tune their sentences as they go, replacing a word here and omitting
a comma there. They may repeatedly shift the order of paragraphs and ideas.
But these writers can draw on ample writing experience as well as deep
knowledge of both written language and their topic. They may be equipped to
draft, revise, and even plan their writing more or less simultaneously.

The great majority of the students we work with, however, lack both that
kind of experience and that level of knowledge. They need to approach
the task one step at a time, while continuing to practice previously learned
strategies, in order to produce an effective piece of writing. As with sentence
activities, even after your students have become experienced at creating
outlines and revising drafts, it’s important to keep practicing the scaffolding
activities that helped them arrive at that point.

## Pacing the Strategies:
## Using Your Judgment

Teachers often ask questions like: “How long should we keep teaching frag ments?” “When can we start the Single-Paragraph Outline?” “Should I stay
with sentence expansion until I think the students have mastered it?” “How
do we know when to start writing introductions?”

We understand that teachers want clear guidelines about the pacing of the
strategies and at what point they should move on to the next one. We wish
we could provide them with straightforward answers, but writing instruction
doesn’t work like that. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. You will need to
determine where your students are at the outset, what they need, and how
fast they are able to move through the sequence of strategies. The beginning of-the-year writing assessment we discussed in Chapter 11 will help you
determine your instructional priorities and objectives, and later formative
assessments will guide you to modify them.

When deciding how long to spend on any one TWR strategy or activity,
you have to exercise your own judgment about your students’ oral and writ ten language abilities. Among the factors to consider are the following:

*   Performance on beginning- and middle-of-year assessments
*   The grade level at which they were introduced to TWR strategies
*   Their familiarity with the conventions of English grammar
*   Their sense of what they need to include, omit, or revise in their
    writing so that it’s understandable to a reader

In addition—as we noted previously—writing, more than any other task,
taxes a student’s working memory and executive functions. Remember that
there’s a limit to how many things we can hold in our working memory. If
your students are still struggling with the mechanics of writing—handwriting,
spelling, usage, and so on—they won’t have the space in working memory to
simultaneously think about higher-level aspects such as purpose, meaning,
audience, word choice, and syntax. Before they can address those consider ations in depth and without guidance, their lower-level skills will need to have
reached a point where the mechanics are not absorbing most of their attention.

## Sequence of Activities through
## the Grades

**The sequence on the following pages assumes that students are being
introduced to the Hochman Method in the given grade level(s).** If that’s
not the case for your students, you’ll need to adjust accordingly. However,
don’t assume that simply because students are in ninth or tenth grade, they
already understand the concept of a sentence or how to plan and construct
an effective paragraph. We know from our experience that many high school
students have yet to acquire these skills.

**All students who are being introduced to the method for the first time,
no matter their grade level, should begin with sentence-level strategies and
activities and proceed through the sequence in order.**

**It is not necessary for students to demonstrate mastery of every sen tence strategy before moving on. Once they have been introduced to a few
basic strategies, they can learn how to develop simple Single-Paragraph
Outlines. They can also use those strategies to convert the words and phrases
they’ve written on their outlines into sentences in a paragraph.**

**The sequence is recursive.** The activities for each of the following grades
incorporate those introduced in all previous grades. They should be a regular
part of instruction for middle and high school students, including both those
who are familiar with the strategies and those who are new to the method.
Always remember that when they’re embedded in the content of the curricu lum, these activities not only teach writing, but also are a powerful method of
teaching subject matter.

Although this book is primarily a resource for grades 3–12, we thought it
would be helpful to include what a K–2 sequence would look like as a founda tion for the grades that follow.

### Grades 11 and 12

**Students should continue to practice all the sentence, note-taking,
paragraph (SPO), revision, summary, and composition (MPO) activities
introduced in grades 9 and 10. Remember that the rigor of the activities is
driven by the content.**

In addition, students should be introduced to the research paper activities
that follow.

The entire process for creating a research paper should first be modeled by
the teacher and practiced as a whole class. Begin with a biographical model.

**PART 1: BACKGROUND ARTICLE, SOURCES, AND RESEARCH PLAN**

*   Read and annotate background article.
*   Gather primary and secondary sources from academic databases.
*   Underline key words and phrases in sources.
*   Develop Works Cited page.
*   Develop research plan and thesis statement.
*   Take notes based on sources on index cards.
*   Sequence index cards based on research plan.

**PART 2: PREPARE EXPANDED MPO ACCORDING TO RESEARCH PLAN**

*   Use notes from index cards to develop details for MPO.
*   Draft research paper introduction.
*   Convert the MPO into a research paper.

Practice the research paper process for the following models:

1.  Biographical
2.  Significant event
3.  Problem or issue
4.  Argumentative
5.  Compare and contrast

## Pacing Guides

Pacing guides displaying the preceding activities in the context of an aca demic year can be found on the Book Resources website.

[SCAN ME]

TWR pacing guides are meant to be fluid. Sometimes you’ll quicken the
pace and at other times you’ll need to backtrack. Bear in mind that your
pace will be determined by your students’ skill level, not their grade level. If
you’re teaching at the middle or high school level, you may be able to proceed
through the sequence of strategies more rapidly than a teacher whose stu dents are in the early elementary grades. But that may not be the case if your
students are still learning English, have language-based learning disabilities,
or face other challenges.

## More than a Writing Method:
## Using TWR to Advance Your
## Students’ Thinking

TWR isn’t just a method of teaching writing—it’s a method of teaching. It
may be different from what you’re used to, and it may take some adjustment.
But teachers have told us that they quickly become comfortable with the
method. Soon they are able to integrate it into all of their instruction:
presenting information, asking questions, checking comprehension, and
setting goals. They use it routinely because they see it’s producing dramatic
improvements not only in their students’ writing but also in students’ mastery
of content, analytical abilities, reading comprehension, and speaking skills.

You’re more likely to see these results if other teachers in your school
are implementing the Hochman Method at the same time and in as many
subjects as possible. Ideally, you’ll be collaborating with these other teachers,
coordinating your pacing, and sharing observations and ideas.

But even if you’re just working on your own, you can have a significant
impact on your students’ writing skills and their learning in general. If you
provide your students with step-by-step strategies that improve their writing

<!-- PAGE 335 -->

and thinking and expand their knowledge—and have them practice the strat egies frequently and consistently—you’ll be providing them with a precious
gift that could well change the trajectory of their lives.

> ## To Sum Up
>
> *   Continue using TWR strategies that you have already taught alongside new
>     ones that you are introducing.
> *   All students, regardless of grade or ability level, should begin with TWR
>     sentence-level activities and practice all of the scaffolding steps that lead to
>     creating outlines.
> *   To decide how long to spend on a particular TWR strategy or set of activities,
>     use your own judgment about your particular students’ needs and abilities.
> *   Use TWR’s pacing guides, in combination with beginning-of-the-year assess ments, to determine goals for the year.
> *   Note that the pacing guide for each grade incorporates all TWR activities
>     described as having been introduced in previous grades.
