## CHAPTER 5

**Planning before Writing: Determining the Shape of What's to Come**

Ms. Allen, a seventh-grade ELA teacher, noticed that whenever she asked her students to produce a written response to a prompt, certain things were bound to happen. 

Some students just put their heads down on their desks, seeming to give up before they had even started. 

Others would start scribbling industriously, raising Ms. Allen's hopes. But when she collected their papers, she was usually disappointed to find pages of disorganized thoughts, often barely understandable. 

And then there was Tyler. Normally good-humored and likable, Tyler seemed to undergo a personality transformation when he was asked to write. He would leave his seat and start poking other students, disrupting the entire class and ignoring Ms. Allen's requests that he sit down. 

At times, he would simply take an extended bathroom break, returning only after the time allotted for the writing assignment was over. 

Eventually, Ms. Allen realized that Tyler wasn't just misbehaving. He was desperate to avoid revealing his inability to write. The students who put their heads down on their desks were less disruptive, but they felt the same way. And the others who produced pages of unintelligible prose? They didn't even realize they weren't able to write coherently. 

Ms. Allen wondered how students could get to seventh grade without knowing how to write a paragraph, let alone an essay. Everyone expected them to have already acquired those skills. If they hadn't, they felt they were failures—and for some kids, like Tyler, that painful feeling led them to act out. 

Students like those in Ms. Allen's classroom *can* learn to write effective paragraphs and essays if they're taught how to plan carefully first. 

If you're about to embark on a road trip, try a new recipe, develop a football play—or engage in just about any complex, multi-step task—you need to have a plan. Without one, it is far more likely that your efforts will be disappointing at best and end in failure at worst. Yet, when we teach our students to write in lengthier forms such as paragraphs and compositions, we don't often help them come up with the kind of plan they need to produce an effective piece of writing. 

Some people say that planning will constrain students' creativity. To the contrary, we've found that teaching students to plan can actually *enhance* their creativity. If students are working from a plan, they're liberated from the need to figure out the overall structure of what they're writing as they go along. As a result, they have the mental space they need to conjure up vivid imagery or relevant details. 

True, some authors prefer to simply free-write as a first step in their writing process, allowing their thoughts to take them where they will. But that approach doesn't work for most students, for at least two reasons. First, most students are not experienced writers. They may still be struggling with figuring out everything from punctuation or word choice to larger questions such as the overall organization of their thoughts. If they're asked to plunge into a longer piece of writing with no outline to follow, they'll need to juggle all these tasks at once. As we explained in Chapter 1, they're likely

to be overwhelmed. 

Second, the free-writing approach to drafting is best suited to relatively free-form genres such as memoirs, poems, plays, short stories, or (perhaps) novels. That's not the kind of writing most of us are expected to produce in college or the workplace. What we are asked to do, in countless situations, 

is to explain, inform, justify, enumerate, summarize, and describe. (A comprehensive list of these expository writing terms can be found in Appendix

A.)

**RESOURCE**

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

Even many experienced writers find planning to be essential if they're going to communicate effectively. As compared to more creative forms of writing, explanatory, argumentative, and analytical pieces demand that authors figure out in advance where they're going to end up and chart a clear and logical course that will lead a reader there. 

As a classic writing handbook points out, “planning must be a deliberate prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.” 1

In short, if you want your students to be able to move from writing effective sentences to writing coherent paragraphs—and, ultimately, compositions

—you'll need to teach them how to plan before they write, using the linear outlines that we present in Chapters 6 and 9. As with revising—which we'll turn to in Chapter 7—planning/outlining is a stage of writing that rarely receives enough instructional time and attention. 

**Offloading the Cognitive Burden: Why Planning Is Crucial**

Why is it so important for students to plan before they write? Largely because of the demands that writing places on **executive functions, ** which are cognitive processes that enable us to plan, monitor, and successfully achieve our goals. They are housed primarily in the prefrontal cortex of the brain and enable us to perform a series of actions that are essential to good writing. The abilities associated with executive functions begin to develop in early childhood, but they don't reach their peak until we are in our mid-20s. That means that virtually all students in kindergarten through twelfth grade are working with executive function abilities that are still a work in progress. 

When assigning writing tasks, teachers need to be keenly aware of the demands they place on a student's executive functions, including working memory. These functions enable a writer to do the following tasks:

**Strategize. ** For beginning or less experienced writers, the teacher, not the student, selects the topic. Selecting a topic demands the ability to foresee consequences. A topic shouldn't be so narrow that there is too little material to write about. If the topic is too broad, a great deal of skill is needed to sort essential from non-essential information. 

**Initiate a series of actions. ** After a topic is selected, students need to find textual evidence to support a topic sentence or thesis statement. 

**Outline. ** Students must be able to develop an outline that provides a road map for presenting a body of information, an explanation, or an argument. When students plan by creating an outline, they will have more cognitive resources to devote to tasks like self-monitoring and instituting needed changes. 

**Organize. ** Students need to sequence information in the outline in the order that suits a particular piece of writing, whether it's a narrative, an argument, or a comparison of two or more different things. 

**Resist distractions. ** The typical classroom and home are full of potential distractions, and the modern era—with its screens and ubiquitous internet connections—seems to have made students' attention spans shorter than ever. 

**Sustain effort. ** Students must maintain the stamina necessary to focus on the writing task at hand. 

**Self-monitor. ** When working on a draft, students need to continually assess it to ensure they're not going off track. They must be able to identify non-essential, less essential, and essential information. 

**Institute needed changes. ** Although students can make changes while creating an outline, most often they will do so while writing or revising a draft. Changes can range from reorganizing an entire sequence of ideas to executing smaller modifications such as choosing more accurate words, varying sentence structure, and inserting transitions. 

A key component of executive functioning is working memory, the aspect of our consciousness where we try to make sense of new information. As we discussed in Chapter 2, writing places a heavy burden on working memory—a burden that scientists call cognitive load. Depending on the topic, even

constructing sentences can impose a heavy cognitive load on inexperienced writers. Writing at length only increases that load, and it can impose a significant burden even if students have good sentence-level skills. Yet students who are still struggling with the basics of writing, at all grade levels, are frequently asked to compose not only paragraphs but entire essays. 

Teachers need to be aware that executive functions are compromised by attention deficit disorders and stress. Stress can be caused by many factors, and nearly all students experience it to some extent. Those who are most likely to experience the levels of stress that interfere with executive functions include students who have language and learning disabilities, those who are still learning English, and those who live in chronically stressful conditions, such as those associated with poverty. Students who are under a great deal of pressure to succeed or who have suffered loss also can experience significant stress. 

However, writing—and especially composing lengthy writing assignments—is such a complex activity that virtually *all* students will experience some level of stress while engaging in it. That's why it's particularly important for them to have a clear, written plan before they begin writing at length. 

Such a plan enables writers to “offload” some of the burden that writing at length imposes on working memory. 2

**TEACHER TIP**

Students can and should learn to plan and outline paragraphs as a whole class even while they're becoming familiar with the various sentence-level skills described in this book. Inexperienced writers can learn a lot from outlining, both about the topic at hand and about how to organize ideas logically when they are guided to do so. However, students shouldn't be expected to outline, draft, and revise longer writing independently until they've acquired the sentence-level skills they need to do so. 

**Identifying Topic, Audience, and Purpose**

To plan a paragraph or a composition, your students need to understand three things: the topic they're writing about, the readers they're trying to communicate with, and the reason they're writing. Initially, you'll need to lead them in class discussions since most students will find it difficult to identify these elements on their own. 

**Choosing a Topic**

It's best to choose a topic that is part of the core curriculum and that students have already learned something about. 

Sometimes students are expected to follow a separate writing curriculum that provides little information about the topics they're supposed to write about. However, it's virtually impossible to write about a topic you know little or nothing about. 

Students are also often asked to write about their personal experiences or opinions—for example, an essay on whether the cafeteria should serve chocolate milk. While students may have the knowledge to engage in that kind of writing, they miss out on the opportunity to use writing to build and deepen their knowledge. 



Even when choosing topics from the core curriculum, it's crucial to determine if students have enough background knowledge about the topic before they begin the planning process. If students need more information, class discussions should help them acquire it or help them identify the best sources to provide it. Students need *some* knowledge to begin planning a piece of writing, but in the process, they may identify gaps in their knowledge and they may take the opportunity to fill those gaps. 

**Determining the Audience**

One of the more challenging aspects of writing for many students is to imagine themselves in the mind of an intended reader. They may struggle to anticipate what that reader would need or want to know and modify their writing accordingly. For example, a paragraph describing Washington, DC, that's directed at an audience of first-time tourists will be very different from one aimed at people who already live or work there. 

Of course, in the context of the classroom, the audience is primarily you, the teacher—and ideally, you'll know at least as much about the topic as your students. But students need to be reminded that in some situations they'll need to tailor the structure, facts, word choice, and arguments in their writing to the kinds of readers they're planning to reach. Even though their teacher may know a lot about the topic, it's important for students to learn how to write for other audiences who don't. 

For example, older students can imagine they're writing about a topic relating to climate change for an audience of third graders. Then have them imagine writing about the same topic for an audience of climate-change skeptics. Would they choose different language? Would they need to explain more information for one group as opposed to another? Would they make different points? 

The intended audience will also determine the tone a writer adopts. Your tone is likely to be different if you're addressing someone you know well as opposed to someone else. On the left in Exhibit 5.1 is an example of a note that I wrote to my husband while dashing out the door, and the example

on the right is a note that I wrote to a friend who was staying with us. 

**Exhibit 5.1**

In most cases, students should adopt a fairly formal tone in their writing assignments since that's the tone they'll usually be expected to take in college and in the workplace. 

Writing prompts and test questions may not specify the audience students should have in mind. In that case, students should generally assume that the reader is someone without a great deal of specific information about the topic. 

Sometimes the prompts themselves will define how much information students need to provide. If a prompt reads “*Summarize* the plot of *Animal* *Farm*,” students will need to relate the key points of the entire plot as if the audience knows nothing about it. If, on the other hand, a prompt reads

“*Analyze* Squealer's role on the farm,” students should focus only on that aspect of the novel. 

**Understanding the Purpose**

Are students trying to persuade the reader to adopt a certain position, or are they simply narrating a series of events? The purpose of a piece of writing influences many of the choices students will make in planning it. A paragraph that is intended to persuade a reader usually has a different kind of topic sentence than one that is describing a situation, place, or person. Similarly, the concluding sentence of a persuasive piece of writing might be a call to action rather than a summary of what's been said. 

Writers will also organize details differently depending on their purpose. If they're writing about a series of events or a process, it will make sense to narrate them in chronological order. But if they're trying to persuade a reader to adopt a particular point of view, they will probably want to begin with their “soft” arguments and end with their strongest. 





**RESOURCE**

Expository Writing Terms  *Appendix A*

The language you use when creating a writing prompt or posing a question for students can signal the particular purpose of the writing you're looking

for, so acquaint your students with the various expository terms and their meanings (see Appendix A). For example, if you ask them to *justify* something, this means the purpose of their writing is argumentative. If you're teaching Level 2 students, you might use some of the following expository terms to help students identify the purpose of a writing assignment:

**Contrast** the candidate's positions with those of his opponent. 

**Summarize** the plot of *The Scarlet Letter*. 

**Discuss** the symbolism in the setting of *Lord of the Flies*. 

**Analyze** the relationship between Finny and Gene in *A Separate Peace*. 

Even younger Level 1 students can practice responding to some of the expository terms. For example:

**Explain** why Mr. Falker was a good teacher. 

**Discuss** why the disappearance of sea ice is affecting penguins. 

**Describe** the garden where Mary meets Ben. 

**Summarize** Chapter 2. 

**A Guide to Purpose: Three Types of Writing**

Identifying the purpose of a piece of writing determines much of the tone and organization of the paragraph or composition. 

To help students identify purpose in writing, TWR emphasizes three types of paragraphs and compositions: **expository**, **narrative, ** and **opinion** or **argumentative. ** In the real world, of course, a single piece of writing often contains more than one of these types at a time. But when students are first learning to write at length, they need practice with one type of writing at a time. Later, when they've become comfortable with the demands of each type, they can begin to blend them in the way experienced writers often do. 

**Expository Writing**

Classes in English, social studies, and science tend to generate assignments that require expository writing. Therefore, most of the time spent on writing instruction should be devoted to teaching students how to do it well. 

Expository writing may explore:

presenting a problem and a solution

analyzing a cause-and-effect relationship

providing a description or giving directions

comparing and contrasting two concepts, events, or individuals and drawing a conclusion based on the facts presented When introducing compare-and-contrast assignments, be aware that organizing those kinds of essays can challenge the skills of many writers. It can be even more difficult to write a single paragraph interweaving two points of view. 

**Narrative Writing**

Narrative writing relates a process, a biography, or event in chronological or sequential order, and is usually organized with transition words that signal time or sequence, such as *first*, *next*, *then*, *later*, and *finally* (see Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases”). In general, narratives are

written in either the first person (as a participant) or third person (as an observer). 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

Narrative writing involving fictional stories or personal experience is not the focus of the Hochman Method. Rather, the kind of narratives we cover might include summarizing a plot in English class, explaining the steps for solving a problem in math, tracing a process in science, enumerating the important milestones in a biography, or identifying what led up to a historic event in social studies. 

**Opinion Writing and Argumentative Writing**

We discuss opinion writing and argumentative writing in detail in Chapter 10, but we'll provide a brief overview of these types of writing here. 

Opinion writing, usually assigned to elementary students, seeks to change how the reader thinks or feels without providing evidence or opposing views. By contrast, argumentative writing presents both sides of an issue, appeals to logic, and gathers evidence and reasons for supporting one side or the other. The conclusion usually proposes the action or point of view that the writer would like the reader to take. 

Education experts consider argumentative writing the most complex and cognitively demanding form of composition.3 As they become more

experienced writers, students may be required to support their claims with evidence and weigh the pros and cons of each side. Perhaps most challenging, they must be able to accurately represent a position with which they may not agree, then take an opposing position and justify it to the reader. 

Most argumentative assignments are given in middle and high schools. Students might be asked to criticize an author's technique or to evaluate the importance of a historical event. But most state writing standards call for students to begin writing “opinion pieces” in the early elementary grades, so it's a good idea to begin instruction in this kind of writing earlier than middle school. 

However, it may be more difficult to find opinion and argumentative assignments for young children that are embedded in the content of the curriculum. If necessary, you might have to assign opinion pieces on non-curricular topics such as “Homework on Weekends.” But if a school is using

an elementary curriculum that is rich in content—and especially, in historical topics—it may well be possible to have students engage in curriculum-based opinion writing. 

Before your students begin to write an outline for an opinion or argumentative paragraph or composition, have them engage in class discussions about their topic. That kind of dialogue or debate can help them determine and refine their own opinions and formulate arguments that their intended audience would find persuasive. 

**To Sum Up**

Writing at length places heavy demands on the aspects of cognition known as executive functions and working memory. 

Before students can plan a piece of writing, they need to identify the topic, the audience, and the purpose. 

Encourage students to write for different audiences, possibly requiring them to alter their topic, their tone, and their word choice. 

As students acquire sentence-level skills, they can begin learning to outline, draft, and revise, BUT only as a whole-class activity. 

Introduce students to the meaning of expository terms such as *enumerate* and *justify* to help them understand the purpose of an assignment or a prompt. 

Provide assignments in the three types of writing: expository, narrative, and opinion or argumentative.

## CHAPTER 6

**A Simple, Linear Guide: Introducing the Single-Paragraph Outline**

It was more than halfway through the school year, and Ms. Chen was getting anxious. Her tenth graders were still struggling to produce even brief coherent written responses to the prompts she gave them. That was especially true if she asked them to incorporate evidence from the text or analysis into their answers. 

She felt like she'd tried everything. She'd broken the writing process into different components, having them take notes on their reading and use sticky notes or index cards to record the evidence they planned to use. She'd had them create concept maps to help them organize their thoughts. It looked like they had some great ideas. 

But when she got their finished products, she was dismayed to see that students usually provided undigested chunks of information without much in the way of analysis. And it was rare to see a paragraph that had a clear topic sentence—or even anything that actually resembled a paragraph. Sentences followed one another in no particular order, and students often wandered away from their topic. She'd tried other kinds of graphic organizers—Venn diagrams and webs—but nothing seemed to work. 

Ms. Chen sometimes wondered if her efforts to scaffold the writing process had only made things worse. It seemed that many students found the multiple sticky notes and the bubbles in their concept maps more overwhelming than helpful. She had run out of ideas for ways to help them express themselves in a clear, coherent paragraph. How could she send them off to eleventh grade without that essential skill? 

Graphic organizers such as thought webs, Venn diagrams, and bubble maps may be helpful for brainstorming, vocabulary instruction, or helping students grasp certain concepts. However, they don't provide an effective template for transferring those ideas into a coherent piece of writing. A crucial step is missing: taking the material in the bubbles, webs, or boxes and figuring out what is most important, what is least important or irrelevant, and how to put the ideas and points in a logical order. 

Some teachers may have tried the Harvard Outline, with its main ideas, sub-ideas, sub-sub-ideas, Roman numerals, and capital and lowercase letters. Although it has the advantage of a linear structure, and it can serve as a great study guide, we've found that the Harvard Outline doesn't translate well into paragraphs or essays. It goes to the other extreme from the free-form bubble map, requiring such high-level categorization and classification skills that students can get bogged down and confused in the planning process. Even if they do manage to complete such a detailed outline, they may find it difficult to convert the complex structure to written text. 

What Ms. Chen didn't realize was that before asking her students to write, she needed to help them through the process of constructing a simple outline. If she had, she might have found that her students’ paragraphs were far clearer and more coherent. 

Teachers may feel pressure to have students write multiple-paragraph compositions, especially at higher grade levels. But teaching students to outline and write a single coherent paragraph first is a crucial investment of time and energy. In one study done with seventh and eighth graders, students who used TWR's Single-Paragraph Outline achieved better results than those who used a concept map or no planning tool at all—and the



students who got the highest writing scores not only used the outline but also had been explicitly taught how to use it. Students also preferred the outline. Of those who used it, 85 percent said it made writing a paragraph easier. 1

Learning to use certain text structures in the context of a single paragraph—such as problem/solution or cause/effect—will help equip students to plan and write essays using those structures later on. And once students are familiar with TWR outlines, they can easily replicate them on scratch paper when asked to provide written responses on tests, or when planning essays and compositions independently. 

**Remember that students should continue to practice sentence-level strategies while learning to outline and draft paragraphs. **

**You also don't have to wait for students to “master” sentence-level strategies before introducing them to the Single-Paragraph** **Outline. These activities can and should be done in tandem. **

**Defining Terms**

A **paragraph** is a group of sentences that includes details supporting a specific point. A well-written paragraph will display the following characteristics:2

**Structure. ** The sentences in the paragraph are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader. 

**Coherence. ** The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal that connection, including indications of a change of direction or emphasis. 

**Unity. ** Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph. 

**Well-constructed sentences. ** The sentences are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary (some simple, others compound or complex). 

**Guiding Students to Create Effective Outlines**

**WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING THE SINGLE PARAGRAPH OUTLINE (SPO)? **

Provides structure (beginning, middle, and end)

Eliminates repetition

Improves ability to stick to the topic

Enables students to distinguish essential from nonessential material

Provides a guide for placing ideas in logical order

Promotes analytical thinking

Provides a template that students can easily duplicate on their own

Enables students to revise more easily than if they start with a draft

Modulates the cognitive load imposed by writing at length

Reinforces content knowledge

Exhibit 6.1 shows a blank SPO (this template is also available full-size in Appendix G):

**Exhibit 6.1** Blank Single-Paragraph Outline

The simple linear format of the SPO benefits all students. 

Solid lines tell students to write complete sentences for the **topic sentence (T.S.)** and the **concluding sentence (C.S.)**. Dotted lines tell students to write notes for supporting details. 

Exhibit 6.2 is an example of an SPO a student has completed—and after that, the paragraph the student might write based on it. 



T.S. ***Bees, the Earth's best pollinators, are at risk of extinction*****. **

***saving bee populations is crucial for sustaining the environment*****. **

**Exhibit 6.2** Example SPO

This chapter provides you with strategies and activities to use when guiding your students to eventually create outlines and paragraphs on their own. 

**SPO Scaffolding Activities**

**The ultimate objective is to enable students to produce an outline independently. However, handing them a blank SPO without** **first teaching them the necessary underlying skills won't produce that outcome. **

Before students can construct an SPO on their own, they will need to learn the steps leading up to that task: creating a topic sentence, including and sequencing relevant details, and crafting a concluding sentence. 

**A topic sentence expresses a paragraph's main idea. ** Make sure students understand that the sentences in the body of a paragraph should provide details that relate to the general idea contained in the topic sentence. 

**When you're modeling using notes for detail sentences, remember not to write full sentences on the dotted lines. ** Usually, when Level 1 students are ready to create SPOs independently, they should also use only key words and phrases for notes, but more experienced writers can add symbols and abbreviations (see Appendix B). 

**RESOURCE**

Symbols and Abbreviations *Appendix B*

When writing in note form on the detail lines, tell students that the notes don't necessarily indicate just one sentence. Specifically, an example or a quotation included on the same dotted line could be written as more than one sentence in the paragraph. 

**A concluding sentence may restate the main idea of the paragraph, although it shouldn't just be a repetition of the topic** **sentence. ** Alternatively, depending on the type of paragraph, a concluding sentence might express a point of view or a call to action. 

**WHY PRACTICE DEVELOPING TOPIC AND CONCLUDING SENTENCES? **

Enables students to make generalizations

Promotes analytical thinking

Enables students to identify key information or concepts

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Developing topic and concluding sentences requires students to consider a collection of facts and information and decide what characteristics unite them—in other words, to develop the ability to make generalizations. Many of the activities that follow will help students in identifying and creating both topic and concluding sentences. Once students have created an effective topic sentence, constructing the concluding sentence is often an easier job. 

**Sequence of SPO Scaffolding Activites:**

1. Create an SPO with the whole class. 

2. Distinguish a T.S. from details. 

3. Identify T.S. and sequence details. 

4. Given T.S., select relevant details from a list. 

5. Eliminate irrelevant detail(s) from a list or SPO. 

6. Given T.S., generate details. 

7. Practice the three strategies for writing a T.S. and C.S. 

8. Given topic/prompt, generate T.S. 

9. Given details, generate T.S. 

10. Given T.S. and details, generate C.S. 

11. Given topic/prompt, construct SPO independently. 

**1. Create an SPO with the Whole Class**

You should have your students practice the steps involved in creating an SPO before asking them to develop one themselves, but it's helpful to demonstrate the entire process first so they know where they're headed. When modeling the SPO for Level 1 students, consider selecting topics that are not complicated or don't require searching for new information. 

Level 2 students can begin learning how to construct SPOs based on a current curriculum topic if most students in the class have already acquired enough information about it to help generate topic and concluding sentences and details. 

There are two ways to develop an SPO with the whole class. One, as shown in the following example, is to have students come up with a topic sentence and then narrate a series of details related to it, perhaps in chronological order. 

**Level 1 Narrative Example**

T.S. ***Try growing bean plants at home*****. **



first 1. ***holes in bottom of container***

next 2. ***put soil in and dig holes***

then 3. ***put seeds in and cover***

finally 4. ***water every day***

C.S. ***It is exciting to watch seeds grow into plants! ***



***Try growing bean plants at home. First, you should put holes in the bottom of a container. Next, put soil in it and dig***

***holes. Then, you put seeds in the holes and cover them with soil. Finally, be sure to water your plants every day. It is***

***exciting to watch your seeds grow into plants! ***

**Level 2 Narrative Example**

T.S. ***It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid. ***



first 1. ***clean container***

next 2. ***fill w/ few in. of liquid***

then 3. ***dip test strip/few sec. ***

finally 4. ***compare color/litmus scale***

C.S. ***If you follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is acidic, neutral, or alkaline. ***

***It is easy to find the pH balance of a liquid. First, thoroughly clean the container you are using. Next, fill the container***

***with a few inches of the liquid you are testing. Then, dip the test strip in the liquid for a few seconds. Finally, compare***

***the color you see to the litmus scale. If you follow these simple steps, you can determine if a liquid is acidic, neutral, or***

***alkaline. ***

The second way to develop an SPO involves brainstorming. The steps that you would take are:

1. Identify a topic, audience, and purpose. 

2. Help students brainstorm 10–15 details about a topic and organize them into categories. 

3. Generate a topic sentence on the solid line on the top of the outline using one of the three TWR strategies (sentence types, subordinating

conjunctions, appositives).* **This can be done before the brainstorming if preferred. **

4. Select, categorize, and sequence details and write them in note form on the dotted lines. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion of TWR note-taking techniques.) *Note that every brainstormed item does not have to be included on the SPO*. 

5. Generate a concluding sentence using one of the three TWR strategies (sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives) on the solid line

at the bottom of the outline.**

*Level 2 students can use all three: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and appositives. Level 1 students should begin with sentence types and then three of the subordinating conjunctions: *before, after, if*. 

**A concluding transition may be appropriate to use at the beginning of the concluding sentence. 

**Level 1 Brainstorming Example**

**TOPIC:** Winter

***soup***

***cold + icy***

***sweaters***

***New Year's Eve coats and scarves ice-skate, ski, sled***

T.S. ***Winter is a unique time of year. ***



1. ***cold, snowy, cloudy days***

2. ***coats, sweaters, hats, gloves***

3. ***hot chocolate, soup, holiday foods***

4. ***skiing, sledding, making a snowman***

C.S. ***Clearly, winter is an exciting season! ***



**Level 2 Brainstorming Example**

**TOPIC:** Achievements of Aztecs

***herbal treatments*** *→**cure diseases***

***1st. civ/dev edu syst*** *→**all children attended***

***adv. calendar*** *→**improved farming***

***adv. math syst*** *→**used area for construction***

***built pyramids/temples for ceremonies***

***built chinampas = floating gardens*** *→**crops*** *↑*

T.S. ***The Aztecs, a Mesoamerican civilization, had many outstanding achievements. ***

1. ***adv. math system*** *→**used area for construction***

2. ***1st civ./dev edu system*** *→**all children attended***

3. ***built pyramids/temples for ceremonies***

4. ***built chinampas = floating gardens*** *→**crops*** *↑*

C.S. ***The contributions of the Aztecs had a great impact on subsequent civilizations. ***

Now that students have an idea of what the end product looks like, it's time to introduce them to the steps involved in creating an SPO. Each step has value in itself and will help students think more analytically, find important points more efficiently, and take notes more effectively. In addition, each step requires modeling by the teacher, as well as oral and collaborative practice, before students can engage in it independently. 

Once students have learned these steps, they not only will be ready to construct an SPO independently but also will have most of the skills they'll need when they move on to planning compositions. 

**2. Distinguish a T.S. from Details**

To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence, present them with three or more sentences and ask them to identify the topic sentence and the sentence or sentences that provide supporting details. You could start with three sentences and ask students to mark one with *T.S*. for *topic* *sentence* and the other two with *D* for *detail*. 

This example assumes that the students have read  *Miss Nelson Is Missing! * 3

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and the supporting details using *D*. 

*** D*** Students had to do lots of homework. 

***T.S*****. ** Ms. Swamp was a very strict teacher. 

*** D*** She cancelled story hour. 

The next example is embedded in content relating to medieval Europe. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and the supporting details using *D*. 

***D*** Art and literature began to reflect the times by including themes of death. 

***D*** Many landowners were ruined financially due to a lack of laborers to cultivate the land. 

***T.S*****. ** The Bubonic Plague, a dreadful disease, had a significant impact in Europe. 

***D*** One third of Europe's population, 25 million people, died. 

***D*** Since many laborers died, many families lost their means of survival. 

**3. Identify T.S. and Sequence Details**

You can increase the level of difficulty by giving students groups of three to five sentences and asking them to first identify the topic sentence and then put the remaining sentences in a logical sequence. This activity will help them understand how to sequence ideas or events within a paragraph. 

In this activity, the transition words signal the sequence of the detail sentences. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and number the supporting details in the correct order. 

***2*** Then, the seed sprouts a plant with flowers. 

***T.S*****. ** The growth of a pumpkin is interesting. 

***3*** Finally, the flowers disappear, and the pumpkin grows! 

***1*** First, a seed is planted in the ground. 

Students who have been studying the Mughal Empire might complete the following activity. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence using *T.S*. and number the supporting details in the correct order. 

***1*** Babur started the empire and removed the Delhi Sultanate. 

***3*** Jahangir continued the policy of tolerance toward Hindus along with most of Akbar's policies. 

***2*** After Babur, Akbar, the greatest Mughal Emperor, laid the foundation for many future leaders. 

***T.S*****. ** There were many rulers of the Mughal Empire. 

***4*** Shah Jahan also continued Akbar's policies and built the Taj Mahal. 

**4. Given T.S., Select Relevant Details from a List**

Provide students with two different topic sentences and a list of details. Have students write each detail under the topic sentence it belongs with. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

long lines

play games

buy souvenirs

lots of walking overcrowded water rides

T.S. Amusement parks are exciting. 

1. ***play games***

2. ***buy souvenirs***

3. ***water rides***

T.S. Amusement parks are exhausting. 

1. ***long lines***

2. ***lots of walking***

3. ***overcrowded***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

occurs in 4 steps

1 diploid cell → 4 haploid cells

used to reprod. somatic cells

daughter cells clone = gen. identical

males make 4 sperm/females only 1 egg

crossing over during proph. 1 → genetically unique cells

seq. of 2 divisions

1 diploid cell → 2 diploid cells

T.S. Mitosis, a step in the cell cycle, results in the division of the nucleus. 

1. ***occurs in 4 steps***

2. ***daughter cells clone = gen. identical***

3. ***1 diploid cell*** *→**2 diploid cells***

4. ***used to reprod. somatic cells***

T.S. Meiosis, a type of cell reproduction, is the process organisms use to make gametes, sperm, and eggs. 

1. ***crossing over during proph. 1*** *→**genetically unique cells***

2. ***seq. of 2 divisions***

3. ***1 diploid cell*** *→**4 haploid cells***

4. ***males make 4 sperm/females only 1 egg***

**5. Eliminate Irrelevant Detail(s) from a List or SPO**

Some students have difficulty distinguishing relevant from irrelevant details or go off topic when they write. If some of your students fall into that category, have them underline or put *T.S*. next to the topic sentence in a list and then cross out the detail that has the least connection to the topic sentence. 

This example assumes that the students have read *The Snowy Day*. 4

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail. 

________ He made a snowman. 

*** T.S*****. ** Peter had a wonderful time on a snowy day. 

________ Peter had a dream that the snow melted. 

________ He made snow angels. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the topic sentence (T.S.) and cross out the irrelevant detail. 

________ Then, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation. 

________ There is only one variable in the equation. 

________ Divide both sides by 3 to solve for *x*. 

*** T.S*****. ** Follow 3 steps to solve 3(x+5) = 45. 

________ Distribute the 3 inside the parentheses to get 3x + 15 = 45. 

**6. Given T.S., Generate Details**

In this activity, you provide students with a topic sentence that you've created on a blank SPO template and have them generate three or four details to go with it. 

For a Level 1 group, you might start with the following sentence. 



**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence. 

T.S. Dogs are popular pets. 

1. ***protective***

2. ***loyal***

3. ***playful***

If you've been teaching Level 2 students about the Incan Empire, you could give them the following sentence. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence. 

T.S. Although the Incan Empire was in power for less than one hundred years, parts of its culture lives on today. 

1. ***Quechuan language***

2. ***celebrate winter solstice***

3. ***textile making***

4. ***irrigation + architecture***

**7. Practice the Three Strategies for Writing a T.S. and C.S. **

When students were doing sentence-level work, they learned strategies to help them create topic sentences. When first explaining how to use these strategies for topic sentences, you should provide the topic and make sure it's one that students are familiar with. 

If you are guiding Level 2 students through the formulation of topic sentences, tell them about all three strategies (see Exhibit 6.3). If you're teaching

Level 1 students, just discuss the first two—sentence types and subordinating conjunctions—and limit the latter to the conjunctions *before*, *after*, and *if*. 

**Exhibit 6.3** Three strategies for creating topic and concluding sentences

**Use a sentence type. **

Students may use a statement, a question, an exclamation, or (possibly) a command. For example, the topic sentence for a paragraph about Washington, DC might be, *Have you ever been to Washington, DC? * Note that while exclamations and commands can be helpful for younger students who are learning to write paragraphs, middle and high school students should generally not use them for topic sentences. 

**Begin with a subordinating conjunction. **

A Level 1 student might use a subordinating conjunction such as *before* to form a topic sentence. For example: *Before you get a dog, you need to* *make preparations*. A Level 2 student might use a more sophisticated conjunction such as *although*—as in *Although the New Deal did not solve* *all of the nation's problems, it saved the United States from economic collapse*. 

**Include an appositive. **

A paragraph about New York City could start with *New York, the nation's largest city, is visited by many tourists*. A paragraph about Genghis Khan might begin *Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, created a large empire*. 

Have your students practice using these strategies to transform boring topic sentences into engaging, informative ones. 

These three strategies are also useful in formulating concluding sentences—which we'll address further on in this chapter. 

**8. Given a Topic/Prompt, Generate T.S. **

After students have had practice writing topic sentences using the three strategies, give them a topic and ask them to create two or three topic sentences for it. Level 1 students are expected to write topic sentences using only sentence types and the subordinating conjunctions *before*, *after*, and *if*. 

If students have been studying endangered species, you might give them the following activity. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write two topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence type and one starting with a subordinating conjunction. 

**TOPIC:** Endangered sea turtles

Sentence Type

***Why are sea turtles endangered? ***

Subordinating Conjunction

***Since sea turtles are endangered, steps must be taken to protect them. ***

**Level 2 Example**

If your Level 2 students have been studying the environment, you might give them the topic *climate change* and ask them to write three topic sentences using each of the three strategies: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and appositives. They might come up with the following sentences. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write three topic sentences about the topic: one using a sentence type, one starting with a subordinating conjunction, and one including an appositive. 

**TOPIC:** Climate change

Sentence Type

***What is the leading cause of climate change? ***

Subordinating Conjunction

***Since climate change has rapidly worsened weather extremes, steps must be taken to reverse it. ***

Appositive

***Climate change, a deviation from usual weather or temperature, has become an urgent problem. ***

**9. Given Details, Generate T.S. **

Provide students with an SPO without topic sentence. The details should be presented in note form. Notes for Level 2 students should include key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols, while notes for Level 1 students should use just key words and phrases. This activity will require students to synthesize a number of details to come up with a topic sentence that brings them all together. 

**Level 1 Example**

If Level 1 students have been learning about the life cycle of a butterfly, you could give them an SPO such as the following one and have them provide a topic sentence. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details. 

T.S. ***Penguins are endangered. ***



1. Emperors + Adélies dropped by 1/2 since 1980s

2. Antarctic sea ice not forming in winter

3. krill disappearing/need sea ice

Students might use the details shown in the following example—and the knowledge that enables them to identify the era being discussed—to generate a topic sentence. 

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a topic sentence for the details. 

T.S. ***The Mayans were a complex Mesoamerican civilization. ***



1. present-day Mexico/Yucatan Peninsula

2. polytheistic/sun + moon + rain gods

3. accurate calendar + math + pyramids

4. possible drought + famine/disease

**10. Given T.S. and Details, Generate C.S. **

The same basic techniques that have enabled students to craft effective topic sentences will work for concluding sentences—with one twist. A concluding sentence should echo the idea of the topic sentence but not repeat it verbatim. 

In some types of writing, the concluding sentence should introduce something new—perhaps a call to action or a personal opinion. However, in many cases, a paraphrase or summary of the topic sentence can serve as the concluding one. Consider the following examples. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and details. 

T.S. What makes summer a special season? 



1. *warm weather*

2. *shorts and T-shirts*

3. *watermelon and ice cream cones*

4. *baseball, fishing, swimming*

C.S. ***In conclusion, summer is an enjoyable time of year! ***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a concluding sentence for the following topic sentence and details. 

T.S. ***The Renaissance was a time of tremendous advancements in many areas. ***



art 1. *Michaelangelo/DaVinci*

education 2. *Gutenberg/printing press*

inventions 3. *watches/microscope*

science 4. *Copernicus/Galileo → astronomy*

C.S. ***The 14th–17th centuries marked a time of major cultural change in Europe. ***

As we discussed in Chapter 4, one way to make a sentence sound more like a concluding one is to introduce it with an appropriate transition, such as

*finally* or *in conclusion*. 

It's best if the topic and concluding sentences don't repeat the same structure. For example, if the topic sentence includes an appositive, then encourage students to use a different structure for the concluding sentence—perhaps a subordinating conjunction or an exclamation. 

**11. Given Topic/Prompt, Construct SPO Independently**

If students have been reading *Mae Among the Stars*,5 you might give them the following activity. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic. 

**TOPIC:** Mae Jemison

T.S. ***Mae Jemison dreamed of going to space. ***



1. ***read books about space***

2. ***teacher suggested being nurse***

3. ***followed dream***

4. ***became astronaut***

C.S. ***Mae Jemison made her dream come true! ***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete an SPO for the topic. 

**TOPIC:** Spanish-American War

T.S. ***The Spanish-American War of 1898 marked a turning point in American and Spanish history. ***

1. ***Cuba wanted independence from Spain/US support***

2. ***sinking USS Maine/Havana Harbor*** *→* ***tensions*** *↑*

3. ***Apr 1898 US declared war on Spain***

4. ***US victory/Dec 1898 Treaty of Paris*** *→* ***ended war***

C.S. ***The Spanish-American War led to the end of Spanish colonial rule and signaled the emergence of the United States***

***as a global power. ***

**SPO: Text Structures**

An SPO enables students to use almost any text structure, including the following standard ones:

Narrative

Descriptive

Problem/solution

Cause/effect

Pro/con

Compare-and-contrast

Opinion/persuasive

You can choose one of the following outlines for a whole-class introduction to adapting the SPO for different text structures, using the sequence of steps described in the preceding sections. If your students have sufficient knowledge about something they've already studied or are studying, you can embed the activity in that content. 

**Narrative**

T.S. ***In 1912, the sinking of the Titanic, a luxury ship, was a disaster. ***



1. ***built for safety/“unsinkable” ***

2. ***speed/ignored signals*** *→**hit iceberg***

3. ***only 20 lifeboats/confusion***

4. ***1500 died/most 1st & 2nd class survived***

C.S. ***Many lessons were learned from this catastrophe. ***



**Descriptive**

T.S. ***Sailing first class on the Titanic was an incredible experience for its millionaire passengers. ***

1. ***cabins = 5 rooms***

2. ***several restaurants + lounges***

3. ***high speed telegraphs/elevator***

4. ***gym, pool, Turkish baths***

C.S. ***The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger ship of its time. ***



**Problem/Solution**

T.S. ***Even though Galileo invented the telescope, Newton and Herschel implemented many modifications that make it***

***what it is today. ***

Problem 1. ***shape of lens/blurry images***

Problem 3. ***fuzzy images + rainbow colors***

Solution 4. ***used mirrors to prevent rainbow colors***

C.S. ***The telescope, an optical instrument designed to make distant objects appear nearer, continues to help us study the***

***sky today. ***



**Cause/Effect**

T.S. ***As a result of France's purchase of Louisiana, major changes took place. *** ______________

Cause 1. ***1800/Napoleon = leader France/Spain returns to LA***

Effect 2. ***US alarmed/feared allies w/ Britain***

Cause 3. ***France @ war w/ GB/Nap needed $*** *→**sold LA to US***

Effect 4. ***Westward Expans./US doubled in size***

C.S. ***The Louisiana Purchase, a critical event in U.S. history, strengthened and expanded the nation. ***



**Pro/Con**

T.S. ***Although he was difficult to work with, Isaac Newton made important contributions to science. ***

– 1. ***accusations of plagiarism***

– 2. ***paranoid about sharing work/sabotaged others***

+ 3. ***1687/published “Math Principles” *** *→**redemption***

+ 4. ***achievements = gravity + calculus***

C.S. ***In summary, despite his flaws, Newton is remembered as a scientific genius. ***



**Compare and Contrast**

T.S. ***Frogs and toads, while similar in many ways, also exhibit distinct differences. ***

Similar 1. ***amphibians/live near water***

Similar 2. ***lay eggs/undergo metamorphosis***

Different 3. ***frogs = smooth + moist skin/prefer wetter environments***

Different 4. ***toads = rough + dry skin/can tolerate drier habitats***

C.S. ***Although they have similarities as amphibians, frogs and toads differ in their physical appearance and***

***habitats. *** ______________

**Opinion/Persuasive**

T.S. ***Since the penny is no longer a useful denomination, it is time to get rid of it. ***

1. ***centuries of inflation*** *→**value of penny*** *↓*

2. ***costs > penny to mint***

3. ***penny = nuisance*** *→**slows down lines***

4. ***nickel = lowest denomination*** *→**easier transactions***

C.S. ***Write to your congressional representative to get the penny retired! ***



**Turning an Outline into a Draft**

After your students have put together a coherent SPO, they are ready to convert the outline into a draft. They'll need to expand their notes on the dotted lines into complete sentences and add those sentences to the topic and concluding sentences they've already written. 

When students convert their SPOs into a draft, the resulting paragraph will be logically organized, on topic, and non-repetitive. At the same time, though, it may not be engaging to a reader. To make their writing flow, students will need to apply the revision techniques that we'll introduce in the next chapter. Those techniques will draw on skills they've acquired through sentence-level activities. 

Bear in mind that leading your students through the process of developing an SPO and later having them complete one independently is a valuable exercise in itself, regardless of whether it results in a written paragraph. Creating an outline deepens and cements students' knowledge of the content it relates to and develops their ability to make generalizations and put information into a logical sequence. **Be sure to give your students plenty** **of opportunities to develop outlines without turning them into drafts and final copies. **

**Differentiating SPO Activities**

For students who need more support in completing an SPO, you can provide the topic or the concluding sentences—or both—and have them write in notes for the details. Students who need less support can come up with their topic and concluding sentences independently. 

Have some students use only key words and phrases for their notes on the dotted lines, while having others use abbreviations and symbols as well. 

If some students need more help coming up with details, you could provide them with cues in the margin while letting others come up with detail categories on their own. 

**To Sum Up**

The SPO is linear and simple, enabling students to order details that support the main idea and eliminate irrelevant information. 

Model the process of creating an entire SPO as a whole-class activity for both Levels 1 and 2 before introducing activities that focus on the SPO scaffolds. 

To help students understand the concept of a topic sentence and learn to organize and sequence details, use the SPO scaffolding activities. 

Build on students' knowledge of sentences to introduce the strategies for constructing topic and concluding sentences: sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, and (for Level 2 students) appositives. 

Guide students through the process of creating non-repetitive concluding sentences. 

As with sentence activities, it's important to keep circling back to the SPO scaffold activities to reinforce the skills used to develop SPOs and to serve as comprehension checks.

## CHAPTER 7

### **Revision: Putting It All Together**

Over the course of the school year, Mr. Chambers's fifth-grade students had acquired an impressive array of sentence-level skills. They'd learned how to use basic and subordinating conjunctions and transition words, and they'd practiced adding appositives and using question words to expand kernel sentences. Mr. Chambers had also led them through the process of constructing a Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO), and they seemed to have grasped it. 

At the end of a unit on insects, Mr. Chambers asked his students to write a paragraph on the life cycle of the butterfly. He was looking forward to seeing how they would apply the strategies they'd learned to their independent writing. 

But when he started reading through what his students had produced, his heart sank. The paragraph written by a student named Mara was typical:

*The life cycle of a butterfly has four stages. The first one is the egg stage. The second one is the larva stage. The third one is the pupa* *stage. The last one is the adult stage. The life cycle of the butterfly is very interesting*. 

The essential information was there—barely. Mara had also written complete sentences, stayed on topic, and created topic and concluding sentences. But the paragraph was wooden and boring. 

Mr. Chambers was sure Mara knew how to construct more complex, varied, and informative sentences as well as how to use transitions to make her writing flow. She and her classmates had done a good job with all of those strategies when given sentence-level activities to work on, or when Mr. Chambers made specific suggestions to, for example, add an appositive to a sentence. But it seemed that, for some reason, they weren't able to apply those strategies to their own writing independently. 

What could he do, Mr. Chambers wondered, to enable them to internalize these strategies and become better independent writers? After all, he wasn't always going to be there to suggest that they add an appositive or use a subordinating conjunction. 

It's crucial to teach students specific writing strategies and then have them use activities you've modeled and created to practice those strategies. It's also crucial to give them targeted feedback on their writing. But that kind of practice and feedback is often not enough to enable them to produce fluent, graceful writing on their own. Of course, they need to learn how to edit their writing. But first, and more important, students need to learn how to revise it. 

**WHY PRACTICE REVISION ACTIVITIES? **

Leads to smoothly flowing, logically connected prose in paragraphs and compositions

Provides a way of incorporating substantive changes into a piece of writing

Enables students to use skills gained from sentence activities and outlining when writing at length

Students may find revision challenging unless it's presented as a step-by-step process. Providing them with an array of activities—which we'll demonstrate in the following sections—will help. 

**Revising versus Editing: An Important Distinction**

Many people see the concepts of revising and editing as one and the same since both processes are necessary to improve a piece of writing. For experienced writers, revising and editing may overlap, but when working with your students you should teach the two processes separately. 

Understanding the distinction between the two is a crucial first step in helping your students transform a boring and disjointed piece of writing into one that engages the reader and flows smoothly. 

**Revising: Improving the Substance**

**Revising** means clarifying or altering the content or structure of a draft. At its core, revising requires writers to put themselves in the shoes of a reader, anticipating what information that reader will need or want to know and determining how to communicate it as effectively as possible. 

Revising is what all good writers do, sometimes repeatedly, to make their writing clear, accurate, and fluid. It can be as simple as substituting a powerful adjective for one that falls flat or as complex as reorganizing the sequence of ideas in an essay to make an argument stronger. For beginning writers, it often involves turning simple rudimentary sentences into rich, complex ones or elaborating on vague ideas with details and examples. For many writers, it may mean eliminating unnecessary verbiage or streamlining convoluted sentence structure. 

To revise, students will build on the planning they engaged in when creating their SPOs. They will also draw on the skills they learned when practicing the sentence-level activities, including harnessing the power of transitions to make their writing flow. 

**Editing: Polishing the Prose**

**Editing**, although important, is often a less complex process. It involves identifying and then correcting errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization, syntax, and spelling. 

Most teachers focus on editing, probably because they are more comfortable with the mechanics and rules of writing. Similarly, if you ask students to improve on a piece of writing, they're likely to make mechanical changes because, when they know the rules, it's easier; adding a comma or capitalizing a proper noun isn't nearly as complex as imagining what a reader needs to know or reorganizing the content of their writing. But it's revising that deserves the lion's share of instructional time and students’ mental effort. To the extent that students do revise, they rarely engage in it with the specificity it requires. 

Experienced writers usually revise and edit simultaneously. However, it's best if students focus on revising *before* they edit. Only after students grow familiar with the process of revising should they be expected to edit, proofread, and otherwise refine their work. Revising may change the wording and structure of a piece of writing, so there's no point in fine-tuning words and passages that may disappear in the next draft. Editing an assignment before it has been revised is like icing a cake before it's fully baked. 

However, that doesn't mean that you should wait until students have reached the editing stage to start correcting their mechanical errors. Even if your objective is to help your students revise their work, you can still point out spelling and punctuation errors without shaping an entire lesson around them. At the end of this chapter, we'll go into further detail on how and when editing should be done. 

**Revision Activities**

The following activities support students’ ability to revise their work. 

**Enriching Simple Sentences through Sentence Expansion**

When your students convert the notes on their outlines into sentences on their drafts, they may produce only brief, simple statements, as Mara did, especially if they're beginning writers. Although short declarative sentences can provide emphasis and make facts clear, a steady succession of them makes for wooden prose. 

How can you guide students to expand these sentences into ones that are longer and richer? 

Remind them that when they've engaged in sentence expansion exercises, they've used question words such as *who*, *what***, ** *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how* to transform kernels into complex, information-packed sentences (see Chapter 3). Now they can use the same kinds of questions to expand the

brief sentences in their drafts in order to provide more information to the

reader—and, if they need some help, you can provide the appropriate question words as prompts. 

For example, let's say one of your students starts to use their outline to draft a paragraph about the book  *Frindle* 1 by Andrew Clements. They might

produce this simple sentence:

Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle.” 

At that point, you can ask: “Do you remember *why* he called it a ‘frindle’?” 

The student might respond: “Because he wanted to perform a language experiment and annoy his language arts teacher.” 

“Great!” you can say. “How about expanding the sentence to include that information?” 

That prompt enables the student to turn their simple sentence into this:

Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle” because he wanted to perform a language experiment and annoy his language arts teacher. 

**Introducing Sentence Variety**

Another way your students can liven up a boring draft is to vary their sentences in length and type. Remind students of the four different sentence types they can use (statement, question, exclamation, and command) and the possibility of beginning a sentence with a subordinating conjunction (see Chapter 4). 

Perhaps, for example, one of your students writes a sentence about colonial America that's followed by another sentence or two using a similar structure:

Colonists needed a way to travel and to water their crops. They settled near rivers. 

You might say, “How about combining those two sentences? And how about beginning with a subordinating conjunction?” The student might then write the following:

Since the colonists needed a way to travel and a way to water their crops, they settled near rivers. 

If you've been regularly assigning your students activities that give them practice with the various sentence-level strategies—embedded in the content they're studying—these techniques will be fresh in their minds. 

**Revisiting Topic and Concluding Sentences**

If your students have completed an SPO, they've already engaged in the process of creating interesting and informative topic and concluding sentences and writing them on an outline. As we detailed in Chapter 6, there are three basic strategies for creating a topic sentence:

Choose one of the sentence types. 

Begin the sentence with a subordinating conjunction. 

Add an appositive. 



You may consider activities in which you would ask students to improve a boring topic sentence as shown in the examples below. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive. 

**In this paragraph, I am going to tell you all about summer. **

1. ***Enjoy summer! ***

2. ***Although summer is a fantastic season, heat waves can be dangerous*****. **

3. ***Summer, a fantastic season, is popular with students because there is***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive. 

**This paragraph is going to be about Genghis Khan. **

1. ***Genghis Khan was one of the most powerful leaders in history*****. **

2. ***Although there have been many memorable leaders, Genghis Khan was one of the most powerful*****. **

3. ***Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, created a large empire*****. **

**Choosing Vivid, Varied, and Precise Words**

One way of enlivening a sentence is to use strong and varied nouns and verbs, as well as modifiers and descriptive phrases. At first, you may need to show Level 1 students where to place adjectives and descriptive phrases in sentences, but eventually students will be able to find the correct placement on their own. 

If students favor overused, easy-to-spell adjectives such as *fun*, *nice*, or *good*, encourage them to find descriptive words that are more specific. You can brainstorm with students, provide them with a list of suggested alternative words, or explain how to use a thesaurus. Instead of *fun, * for example, a student might substitute *exciting* or *sensational*. Instead of *good*, you might suggest *enjoyable* or *fantastic*. It's often a pleasant surprise to see the better choices students make when they brainstorm for more precise and varied alternatives. 

If students have been reading *Because of Winn-Dixie*,2 you might give them the following activity:

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of adjectives for the bolded word below. 

Opal is a **nice** girl. 

***friendly respectful***

***generous compassionate***

***helpful***

***kind***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of more precise words or phrases for each of the following bolded words or phrases. 

1. **A long time ago**, people fought for freedom. 

***During the Revolutionary War In the late 18th century***

***From 1775 to 1783***

***During the colonial period***

***After the Boston Tea Party***

***During the American War of Independence***

2. A long time ago, **people** fought for freedom. 

***the Continental Army***

***colonists***

***the New England colonies revolutionaries***

***the Sons of Liberty***

***Americans***

Two of the basic conjunctions, *but* and *so*, lead to more sophisticated words that students should be encouraged to use in their independent work. 

Remember that students should use the more sophisticated words in Exhibit 7.1 at the beginning of their sentences rather than in the middle. 

**but**

**so**

**change of direction cause → effect**

**Using Transitions to Create Flow**

Your students should be familiar with the transition words and phrases we discussed in Chapter 4. If you guide them to insert appropriate transition

words and phrases during the revision process, their writing will become significantly more fluid and coherent. To demonstrate how powerful these brief

insertions can be, show your students examples in literature or expository writing and have them identify where transitions are used. 

A transition may begin a sentence, creating a link between that sentence and the one that has preceded it, or link thoughts within a sentence. 

Transitions can also underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph's various sentences together. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

If your students have trouble deciding what kind of transition to use when revising, you can suggest a specific category from Appendix C for them to look at. With enough practice, they'll be able to find the right kind of transition independently. 

Transitions—when used correctly—are vital to the creation of coherent paragraphs and compositions. As a reminder, the basic types of transitions and their functions are shown in Exhibit 7.2. 

**Types of Transitions**

**Time and sequence**—provide sequence of events, steps in a process

**Conclusion**—express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution

**Illustration**—give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement

**Change of direction**—signal contrasting thoughts

**Emphasis**—prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated

**Exhibit 7.2** Transition Words and PhrasesTypes of Transitions

**TECHNICAL TIP**

The table of transitions in Appendix C describes the functions of the five types of transitions. It is not an exhaustive list, but the words and phrases we've focused on are the ones students are most likely to encounter in texts and literature. Consider giving students a copy of

Appendix C to refer to when they are revising. 

**Introducing the Unelaborated Paragraph**

We often notice that students can apply TWR techniques when a teacher provides them with structure, but then have difficulty when writing independently. This issue usually emerges when students revise their drafts. A student might, for example, improve a sentence by adding an appositive when you specifically suggest that strategy, but he won't come up with the idea on his own. 

An effective way to solve this problem and see improvement in students’ independent writing is by using the **unelaborated paragraph**. Students may be reluctant to change their own writing after they've already invested some effort in getting it down on paper. They may be far more likely to practice revision strategies on a piece of writing composed by someone else. 

**WHY PRACTICE REVISING UNELABORATED PARAGRAPHS? **

Helps students learn to use TWR strategies with careful scaffolding and then apply them to their own writing independently Enables them to practice revision techniques on text for which they don't feel a sense of ownership

Deepens their understanding of content

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

The idea is to give students a bare-bones paragraph consisting of four to six simple sentences and then guide them through the process of improving it. 

**Unelaborated paragraphs should have no errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, or grammar so that students can focus** **on revision, not editing. **

To enrich and expand the sentences and make the paragraph flow, students will be drawing on the sentence-level strategies they've learned, including their knowledge of transitions, and getting practice in using varied vocabulary. Your directions to students for revising the paragraph should draw only on skills that you have explicitly taught them. 

As with all TWR activities, introduce the unelaborated paragraph as a whole-class activity, under your guidance. Ideally, it should be embedded in content students have studied. If that's not possible, choose a subject students know well. If they don't have a command of the subject, students won't be able to provide the details they'll need to improve and expand the paragraph. 

Here is a Level 1 example of what it might look like as students revise an unelaborated paragraph. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Gold used the following unelaborated paragraph with her Level 1 students about the class's trip to the aquarium: The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch. The bus ride was fun. It was a very good field trip! 

“This is a pretty boring paragraph, isn't it?” Ms. Gold asked after posting the paragraph in her classroom, and the students agreed. “Let's see if we can make it more interesting. *When did we go to the aquarium?” *

“Last week!” the students called out. Ms. Gold added the words *Last week* to the beginning of the first sentence. 

“Okay, great!” Ms. Gold said. “But what about this next sentence? *What* could we add to that?” 

“We could say, *we saw many different sea creatures, *” a student offered. 

“That's a good idea. What about the next sentence? *When* did we eat lunch? *Where* did we eat lunch?” 

As she made her way through the paragraph, Ms. Gold continued the process of asking questions and adding students’ responses to the board. Other questions she asked included the following:

“Why was the bus ride fun?” 

“Can we think of a better word than *good* in the last sentence?” 

After this, she gave the students a worksheet that reflected her discussion with the class about how to revise the unelaborated paragraph. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow. 

The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch. The bus ride was fun. It was a very good field trip. 

1. Expand T.S. (when?)

2. Sentence 2: Vary vocabulary, be specific (lots, fish)

3. Sentence 3: Expand (when? where?)

4. Sentence 4: Vary vocabulary (fun)

5. Sentence 4: Expand (why?)

6. C.S.: Vary vocabulary (good)

***Last week, the third grade went to the aquarium. We saw fantastic sea creatures such as dolphins. Later, we had lunch***

***outside at the picnic tables*****. The bus ride back to school was great because we had snacks and talked to our friends. It was** **a wonderful field trip! **

More experienced writers will be able to improve unelaborated paragraphs with less scaffolding. But don't stop giving such students unelaborated paragraphs because you think they're too easy! They continue to be an extremely effective activity even for high school students as a check of comprehension and as an opportunity to practice revision. 

**Level 2 Example**

Here is an example of a Level 2 activity. The class was studying the accomplishments of famous women in American history. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow. 

Eleanor Roosevelt was important. She was married to Franklin Roosevelt. She was the First Lady from 1933 to 1945. She made many contributions. Many people admired her. 

1. Improve T.S. and C.S. 5. Vary vocabulary

2. Expand sentences

6. Use an appositive

3. Use transitions

7. Give examples

4. Combine sentences

8. Use a subordinating conjunction

***Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most admired women of the 20th century, was the wife of President Franklin Delano***

***Roosevelt and First Lady from 1933 to 1945. Although she was born into great wealth and privilege, she was extremely***

***aware of the injustices suffered by those less fortunate. She became a passionate advocate for human rights, and is***

***remembered as an author and activist. After FDR's death, President Harry Truman appointed her as a delegate to the***

***United Nations, where she gained worldwide respect and received many honors and awards for her achievements. ***

***Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt the “First Lady of the World.” ***

In composing this informative and smoothly flowing paragraph, students are demonstrating their ability to create sophisticated sentences and a sense of organization. At the same time, they are drawing on and deepening their knowledge of the topic. 

**Differentiating Unelaborated Paragraph Activities**

Provide all students with the same bare-bones paragraph, but give some students fewer instructions for revision. For example, give some students a list of six things to do and limit others to only one or two. 

Make directions explicit as opposed to general. For example:

*Explicit*: Use an appositive in the T.S. 

*General*: Improve T.S. 

*Explicit*: Add *where* to the fourth sentence. 

*General:* Expand sentences. 

**Moving from Unelaborated Paragraphs to Independent Revision**

The main goal of giving students unelaborated paragraphs is to enable them to make similar revisions in their own writing without a teacher's prompting. 

The following steps will lead students to that goal:

1. Revise an unelaborated paragraph as a class. 

2. Give students an unelaborated paragraph with explicit directions and have them work in pairs, small groups, or independently. 

3. Have students revise an unelaborated paragraph, without directions, independently, in pairs, or with a small group. 

4. Have students revise their own work after getting teacher feedback that reflects the language used in TWR strategies and activities—for example, 

“add a transition.” 

5. Have students revise their own work independently, using the techniques they have practiced. 

As your students become accustomed to revising their writing, encourage them to revise their drafts more than once. In fact, point out that in most cases, the better the writer, the more times she will rework a draft. 

**It's important to note that many lessons can end after revisions and edits**. A polished final copy of a paragraph or composition is not necessary to achieve the lesson's objectives. 

Generally, introductory revision assignments should be kept brief. It's best for Level 1 writers to limit their revisions to one paragraph of five or six sentences. That's also true for more able writers who are still learning how to make substantive revisions. If students write at greater length, they may find it difficult to revise and edit and become discouraged. **Clarity and accuracy, not length, are the goals. **

When students are writing by hand, stress that they should leave room on their papers for revising and editing their drafts by skipping lines. If students are using a computer, they should double or triple space for the same reason. For drafting and revising written work and printing final copies, computers are invaluable—as long as students learn keyboarding skills and become proficient typists. If they have to hunt and peck at a keyboard, students will be distracted during the complex process of composing. 

**Giving Students Feedback**

Feedback on drafts should be tailored to an individual student's level of proficiency. When your students are writing drafts, they may write sentences that need to be expanded. With Level 1 students, your feedback should be explicit. For example, you might insert *when? * or *why? * at specific points in their writing. With Level 2 students, you will be able to just write *expand* on their work. That should encourage them to consult the question word chart you've posted on the wall, which can help them determine which of the question words are relevant to their sentences. 

After being taught how to construct sentences, craft SPOs, and use transitions, students should be able to understand the following notes and abbreviations. This kind of feedback is far more helpful than just saying “make it better” or “add more details” and hoping for the best. 

**BRIEF BUT TARGETED FEEDBACK**

**when? why? ** [expand this point]

**ext w/ so →** [extend with *so*]

**ex. ** [provide an example]

**app. in T.S. ** [use an appositive in topic sentence]





**insert transition**

**sub. conj. in C.S. ** [begin concluding sentence with a subordinating conjunction]

**combine sent. 2 & 3**

A teacher might also point out, more generally, places where a student got off track, using words like:

repetitive

irrelevant

Exhibit 7.3 is an example of feedback included directly on the draft. 

**Exhibit 7.3**

**Editing: Last but Not Least**

Once students have a final draft, it's time to proofread—that is, check for errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. Many students, especially those at Level 1, will need help spotting those errors and correcting them. 

As we discussed in Chapter 1, researchers have unanimously concluded that teaching grammar rules in isolation doesn't work for most students. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't teach grammar. What *does* work is to teach grammar—along with writing conventions such as spelling and punctuation—in the context of the activities students are assigned or do in class. 

In Chapters 2 and 4, we pointed out that it's best, whenever possible, to teach grammar and conventions in the context of sentence-level work, where

the number of errors is likely to be more manageable than in lengthier student writing. But even if you've done that, most students will continue to make at least some mechanical errors when they move on to paragraphs and compositions—although perhaps not as many as they would have otherwise. To give your students the skills that will enable them to avoid distracting readers with technical mistakes, continue to identify and correct these errors in your students’ drafts. 

**Saving Time with Proofreading Symbols**

If you familiarize your students with standard proofreading symbols, such as a caret (˄) to indicate an insertion, you'll be able to use those symbols to

give quick and specific feedback on their writing during both the revision and editing stages. (You'll find a list of proofreading symbols in Appendix

D.) If you simply circle a grammatical error such as a lack of subject-verb agreement, there's a good chance the student won't understand what the

problem is. 

**RESOURCE**

Proofreading Symbols  *Appendix D*

Take the time to make sure students know what mistakes they've made and that they know how to correct them. There's no other way to ensure that they'll learn the rules. Using symbols to communicate precisely what the error is will make the revision and editing process much more efficient. 

Busy teachers often have difficulty finding the time to provide detailed feedback on students’ writing. But if you've laid the groundwork, you can provide shorthand feedback fairly quickly. And students will not only understand your abbreviations but also know how to follow through on the suggestions you've given them. 

**RESOURCE**

Student Revise and Edit Checklist  *Appendix E*

When students become more adept at revision, you may want to provide them with the “Student Revise and Edit Checklist” in Appendix E, adapting

it as necessary to your students’ needs and level of ability. Students can then go through the checklist on their own and ensure that their paragraphs and compositions are the best they can be. 

**To Sum Up**

Revising, or making structural improvements to a draft, should be done before editing, which consists primarily of correcting mechanical errors. 

To help students revise their drafts, remind them to use sentence expansion, sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives, and sentence-combining to vary their sentence structure. 

Encourage students to use vivid and precise words in the revision process. 

Transition words signal the connections between sentences and ideas and create smoothly flowing prose. 

Before students try to revise their own writing, have them practice on unelaborated paragraphs that you provide. 

Use proofreading symbols and abbreviations for TWR strategies so feedback is explicit and brief.

## CHAPTER 8

**Summarizing: Finding the Main Idea of a Text**

Ms. Buxbaum's eleventh-grade social studies class had been studying the American Revolution and its aftermath. She'd given her students an article to read on the Constitutional Convention and asked them to summarize it. 

Jamal's summary went on for three pages, recounting details such as the names of the first few colonies to select delegates in the early months of 1787, the oppressive heat in Philadelphia that summer, and the introduction and rejection of the New Jersey Plan. 

Felicia's summary, on the other hand, was just two simple sentences:

*Delegates from the colonies met in Philadelphia. They drafted the Constitution*. 

Neither of these summaries was exactly what Ms. Buxbaum had in mind. Jamal clearly knew a lot about the Constitutional Convention, but had trouble distinguishing important events from colorful but essentially irrelevant details. And Felicia's summary had left out some crucial information—like when the Constitutional Convention had taken place. 

Ms. Buxbaum realized that students like Jamal and Felicia needed more guidance in exactly what a summary should include. But she wasn't sure how to provide it. 

Students often have trouble figuring out how much to say and what to focus on when they're asked to summarize. How much is too much? How much is too little? What's important and what's not? Teachers’ guides may require students as young as second grade to summarize a chapter or an entire book. Yet even many high school students find it challenging to come up with a good summary, struggling to find the right level of succinctness or detail. 

**The Power of Writing Summaries**

A **summary** is a brief statement that presents the main points of a text, in a concise form, either in writing or orally. 

Teachers sometimes underestimate the importance and the challenges of having their students learn to craft effective summaries. Summarizing is so powerful because it requires you to get to the essence of whatever you're trying to summarize. If you transfer a mental or oral summary to written form, it can be especially powerful because you have to think even more intensively about what you want to say. A written summary is also easier to critique and rework. But writing also imposes a greater cognitive load than thinking or speaking, and inexperienced writers can find it challenging to create a written summary without explicit instruction. 

Students at any grade or ability level can learn to summarize, although your approach may vary depending on your students’ skill level, the complexity and knowledge demands of the text, and other factors. The skills students have acquired through learning to expand a sentence or create a Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO) will give them a valuable boost in writing summaries. 

**WHY PRACTICE SUMMARIZING? **

Boosts reading comprehension

Acts as a comprehension check

Helps generate concise and accurate responses to questions

Maintains focus on the main idea and most relevant details

Teaches paraphrasing techniques

Provides practice synthesizing information

Enhances the ability to analyze information

Develops the ability to make generalizations

Aids in retaining information and vocabulary

Summarizing information is something we all need to do, often many times a day—and not only inside a classroom. Just to name a few examples, summarizing comes into play when we're asked to do any of the following:

Relate an experience or process

Describe someone or something

Sum up a plot

Give directions

Present a critical review

The difficulty of summarizing varies with the content, the complexity of the language and syntax, and the depth of knowledge the reader has about the topic. To see what we mean, try summarizing the following paragraph, which appears on the first page of Immanuel Kant's *Critique of* *Judgement*:1

*We proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide Philosophy, as containing the principles of the rational cognition of things by means of* *concepts (not merely, as logic does, principles of the form of thought in general without distinction of Objects), into theoretical and practical. *

*But then the concepts, which furnish their Object to the principles of this rational cognition, must be specifically distinct; otherwise, they would* *not justify a division, which always presupposes a contrast between the principles of the rational cognition belonging to the different parts of a* *science*. 

Not so simple, especially if you don't have a graduate-level degree in philosophy! 

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Reviews of multiple studies have found that summarizing can be a powerful boost to reading comprehension and learning. 2 When students

are taught how to create summaries, the research has found that the practice helps them identify the main idea of a text, make generalizations, and retain information. 

One review of the research found that the effects were particularly strong in the elementary grades. It also found that writing summaries worked better than simply having students read a text multiple times, read and study it, or receive instruction in reading skills. 3

Teachers are often told they should have students summarize material, but they're not necessarily told why or how. Now that we've explained why summarizing is important, we'll tell you how to teach this critical skill. 

**Three Questions to Ask before You Begin**

Before you ask your students to start summarizing, there are three questions you'll need to answer first. 

**Do your students have sufficient knowledge of the topic to summarize it? ** It's best to embed summarizing activities into the content you're teaching and to ensure that you have spent enough time on that content to enable students to write about it intelligently. 

**What is the purpose of the summary? ** Is it a comprehension check you'll collect or a study aid for your students? 

**What is the format? ** Will the summary be a single sentence, an outline, or a paragraph? 

**Two Structures for Summaries**

The following two formats, the summary sentence and the SPO, will help your students structure their thoughts about the information they have read, heard, or collected. Which one you use will depend on the text to be summarized, the purpose of the summary, and the ability level of your students. Both formats will require your students to go back into the text, read closely, and find the main idea and most important points. 

As always, it's a good idea to complete these activities as a class before asking students to try them on their own. 

**The Summary Sentence**

The first format, the **summary sentence** template, looks a lot like the one your students have used for sentence expansion. The question words are the same, and summarizing draws on many of the same skills as sentence expansion, but there is no kernel sentence provided as a starting point. 

Instead, students will be summarizing a specific text—a story, a paragraph, a book chapter, or an article. 



**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the summary sentence. It is not necessary to use all the question words. Respond only to the ones that are relevant. 

Who/What? 

***Maya ***

(did/will do) What? ***built urban centers***

When? 

***pre-Columbian era***

Where? 

***throughout their empire***

Why? 

***N/A***

How? 

***expertly***

**SUMMARY SENTENCE:** ***During the pre-Columbian era, the Maya expertly built urban centers throughout their empire*****. **

When you give your students a text to summarize, clarify what you want them to focus on when they create their summaries if the content lends itself to several possibilities. When students are expanding a brief kernel sentence, the focus is clear. But a paragraph, article, or chapter may cover a range of possible subjects. If you want students to focus on one aspect of the text, be sure to make that subject explicit. 

For example, let's say you've asked students to summarize an article about tornadoes occurring in a particular state, and you expect them to focus on the

damage the tornadoes caused. Some students might choose to focus instead on the timeline of the events or the areas and people that were impacted. 

Unless you designate the subject, you may not get back the kind of summary you anticipate. 

In addition, make sure students know that they won't need to answer all the question words that are listed. When students are still learning to create summary sentences, it's important to guide them through thinking about which question words will be relevant for a specific text and tell them that if a certain word isn't appropriate, they should put “N/A” (not applicable) on the dotted line next to it. 

Many newspapers and magazines summarize their articles in a single sentence at the beginning as a way of letting readers know what will follow. 

Often, book and movie reviews and television shows are summarized in a single sentence. Consider showing your students how frequently this type of brief summary appears. 

**The end product of the summary sentence activity is an informative, coherent sentence that could often work as the topic** **sentence of a paragraph. Standing alone, it serves as a way of identifying the main idea of a text. **

**TEACHER TIPS**

Have students create a summary sentence at the beginning of a class as a do-now activity, based on homework or material that was previously covered. 

Review material that the class has covered. For example, if students have been reading *Macbeth*, try having them summarize one of his soliloquies. 

Students should write their answers to the question words in the form of notes on the dotted lines. 

Begin summary sentences with the answer to the *when* question, if that's appropriate for the text being summarized. 

Single-sentence summaries can be practiced orally, as a whole-class activity, to help students stay concise and on topic. 

Be sure to post the question words prominently. 

**BE CAREFUL**

Simpler texts, particularly those that have been “modified” or “adapted,” are harder to summarize because they include less information and therefore are effectively already summarized. Make sure the text you're giving students to summarize has enough detail and complex language to enable them to distill it. 

At the same time, the text shouldn't be so complex that students can't understand it. Text selection can be tricky, so teachers should be the ones to do it rather than the students, at least initially. 

**Summarizing with the SPO**

Students can use the SPO to plan a paragraph that provides a summary. Many of the same skills they learned in connection with the SPO are also involved in developing summaries:

Distinguishing between essential and nonessential information

Reducing text to notes or paraphrases

Organizing the points they want to make

Synthesizing information and making generalizations

Rephrasing a topic sentence as a concluding one

When students use the SPO for a summarizing activity, they will be referring to a specific source and mining it for the information they'll need to complete the outline. Students will need to do the following:

Identify details that support the topic. 

Generate a topic sentence. 

Select and sequence supporting details. 

Write the details as notes on the dotted lines. 

Generate a complete concluding sentence. 

When introducing summarizing, a sixth-grade teacher asked his students to read an article about the importance of wearing the right sunglasses. 4

Next, the whole class developed the following SPO. The paragraph following the SPO was written independently. 

T.S. ***While cost and style are factors to consider when shopping for sunglasses, effective protection is most important*****. **

1. ***UVA + UVB = damaging rays*** *→**cataracts***

2. ***decal/absorb 99-100% harmful rays/polarized***

3. ***style/wrap-around***

4. ***cloudy days + winter*** *→**UV radiation***

C.S. ***In conclusion, wearing well-chosen sunglasses throughout the year is crucial for protecting the health of your eyes*****. **

***While cost and style are factors to consider when shopping for sunglasses, effective protection is most important. ***

***Consumers need to know about the dangers of UVA and UVB rays because they can cause great damage, including***

***cataracts. Look for a decal stating that the glasses are polarized and can absorb 99–100% of harmful rays*****. *Wrap-***

***around styles are best for protecting your eyes on all sides. Many people don't know that UV radiation exists on cloudy***

***days and during the winter. As a result, their eyes can be at risk. To conclude, be diligent when shopping for the safest***

***sunglasses*****. **

**To Sum Up**

Summarizing builds on skills students have developed in sentence expansion activities and in creating SPOs. 

Before asking students to summarize, make sure they have sufficient knowledge of the topic to understand the text you're asking them to summarize, and that they can identify the intended purpose and format of the summary. 

Make sure students have had ample practice with sentence expansion before tackling summary sentences, which are significantly more challenging. 

When asking students to complete the templates for the summary sentence, first make sure they understand what to fill in for the

“who/what” and “did/will do (what)” lines in order to clearly identify the topic. 

Students who have been introduced to the SPO can use it to summarize specific text. 

Have students practice summarizing both orally and in writing.

## CHAPTER 9

**Moving On to Compositions: The Transition Outline and the Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

As spring rolled around, Ms. Hamilton knew her fifth graders would soon be expected to produce extended written responses to prompts on their end-of-year state reading tests. They would be asked to read a passage on a topic they might or might not be familiar with and to write at length in response to a prompt about that passage. 

In an effort to prepare them for the test, Ms. Hamilton had them read an article about the threat of extinction for the honeybee and write about the causes and effects of extinction. The results weren't encouraging. 

Ava wrote one long paragraph that basically repeated the same nugget of information—more or less verbatim from the text—over and over. 

Michael's response included a lot of information about the extinction of dinosaurs but had little to do with honeybees. Brandon related a number of details from the article but listed them in no particular order. And Trina—along with a number of other students—just put her head down on her desk, apparently too overwhelmed by the assignment to even try to come up with a response. 

Ms. Hamilton wasn't sure what to do. Was the test expecting too much of fifth graders—or at least of the fifth graders in her classroom? Or was there something missing from her teaching? Whatever the problem, in a few short weeks her kids would be expected to produce extended, coherent written responses to a prompt on a test. And she was pretty sure most weren't going to be able to do it. 

If writing is hard, then writing at length only makes it harder. One reason it's important to start writing instruction at the sentence level is that it lessens the heavy load that writing imposes on working memory, freeing up cognitive capacity. But even if students have learned how to construct good sentences, writing at length can still result in an overwhelming cognitive load. Writers may need to juggle many complex items in working memory—for example, keeping track of what they've already said or what they're planning to say next. That's why linear outlines are so important: they can “offload” some of that cognitive burden. 

As students reach higher grade levels, they're expected not only to write at length but also to write well about topics beyond their personal experience, which requires them to juggle that content in working memory along with the demands of writing. A heavy emphasis on personal narratives in the elementary grades often leaves students unprepared to meet those kinds of writing expectations in middle and high school. 

In response to that problem, many states have adopted standards requiring that students write at length and in a variety of genres beginning in the elementary grades—informational and opinion essays as well as narratives. No longer is it enough for a fourth grader to write a paragraph about his summer vacation or a trip to the zoo. The standards may require him to be able to write, for example, compositions that “introduce a topic or text clearly, state an opinion, and create an organizational structure in which related ideas are grouped to support the writer's purpose.” 1

While it's important to prepare younger students for the writing demands they'll encounter at higher grade levels, the standards tell us only where students need to end up without explaining how to get them there. Writing standards and assignments based on them are rarely grounded in realistic expectations of children's development, nor do they account for the heavy cognitive load that writing imposes on inexperienced writers of any age. 

When asked to write at length in an expository mode, students at all grade levels often struggle with sentence structure, organization, clarity, and coherence. Simply handing out longer and more challenging writing assignments doesn't magically give students the skills they need to create well-crafted compositions. 

A **composition** (essay) is a series of paragraphs united by a common theme. The characteristics of effective compositions mirror those of effective paragraphs:

**Structure. ** The paragraphs are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader. 

**Coherence. ** The paragraphs are logically connected with appropriate transition words. 

**Unity. ** Every paragraph supports the main idea or thesis of the composition. 

**Well-constructed sentences. ** The sentences within each paragraph are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures should vary (some simple, others compound or complex). 

Over the course of many years, my colleagues and I have analyzed countless compositions, research papers, and essays. After looking at both long-term assignments and timed responses to essay questions on tests, we realized that we needed a structured, sequenced method for guiding students to compose longer pieces of writing. A crucial component of that method is to explicitly teach students how to create a linear outline, building on what they've learned about outlining a paragraph. 

**The Benefits of Outlining**

**WHY PRACTICE OUTLINING FOR A COMPOSITION? **

Reveals gaps in knowledge or comprehension to both teachers and students

Develops organizational skills

Helps in categorizing information

Provides students with a logical sequence for expository, narrative, and argumentative text structures

Avoids repetition and irrelevant information

Promotes well-structured introductions and conclusions

Develops efficient note-taking skills

Strengthens the ability to create transitions between ideas and paragraphs

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Creating an outline will help your students cement knowledge they've already acquired and gather new information that builds on it. Once students are familiar with outlines and the associated skills, they'll be able to reproduce outlines on scratch paper during tests and use them to write clearer and more coherent responses. 

**It's important to remember that, as with the SPO, creating the outline is a powerful activity in itself, regardless of whether a** **student turns it into a draft or a finished product. ** And, as always, it's important to continue sentence-level activities while students are learning to create outlines for compositions. 





**The Transition Outline and Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

The Transition Outline (TO), shown in Exhibit 9.1, is designed for students who are ready to write more than one paragraph but not yet ready for the

task of writing complete introductions and conclusions. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Outline (TO),  *Appendix L*

A composition based on the TO begins with a single sentence, the **thesis statement**, and ends with a single sentence, the **concluding statement**. 

Typically, such one-sentence paragraphs are found only in fiction or journalistic writing. Nevertheless, we believe it's important to give students an easier option to introduce and conclude a subject before teaching them how to write more fully developed introductions and conclusions, which we'll describe later in this chapter. 

**RESOURCE**

Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO) *Appendix Q*

Some students may be ready to move directly to the more challenging Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO), shown in Exhibit 9.2, without first creating TOs.

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**



**Exhibit 9.2**

Students who are familiar with the SPO but not ready for the format of the TO or the MPO can use a Pre-Transition Outline (PTO). The format of the

PTO can be found later in this chapter, under “Adapting the TO and MPO: Pre-Transition Outline (PTO),” and in Appendix J. 



**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)  *Appendix J*

You will need to use your judgment about what your students are equipped to handle. In classes where there is a significant range of ability, you may decide to provide some students with the TO and others with the MPO, even if all are writing about the same content. 

**Prepping for the TO and MPO**

If you've given your students ample practice creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs), they will have already acquired some of the prerequisite skills needed for developing a TO on their own. Specifically, they will have learned how to:

Write supporting details in note form, using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols

Organize and categorize details

They'll also need to acquire two new skills:

Generating a thesis statement that summarizes the theme or main idea of an entire essay

Generating a concluding statement that rephrases the thesis statement

To construct these statements, students will draw on and extend the generalizing abilities they've acquired in summarizing and in composing topic and concluding sentences for the SPO. 

Similarly, when it's time to draft and revise a composition using the TO, students who have had experience writing paragraphs will already have acquired some of the skills they need:

Creating topic sentences

Using a variety of sentence structures

Connecting sentences with transition words and phrases

But they will also need to acquire some new skills through repeated practice, including:

Expanding their use of transition words and phrases to connect paragraphs as well as sentences

Learning how to smoothly incorporate quotations from text into their writing

Level 2 students who are ready to move on to drafting and revising compositions using the MPO will also need to acquire another, more challenging skill:

Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs that include not only a thesis statement but also at least two more sentences that provide a larger context for it

When you're introducing students to the TO or the MPO, it's best to base writing assignments on what students have studied previously or are currently learning, as long as they've had time to acquire a good deal of information about the topic. Advanced Level 2 writers can be assigned topics that require research. 

We'll begin by explaining how to guide students through the less complex TO process and then discuss how to teach the skills required for the MPO

to those Level 2 students who are ready to tackle it. Argumentative compositions, which are particularly challenging, will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. 

**Introducing Students to the TO**

Even after students are comfortable creating an SPO and using it to draft a paragraph, they may still need more support before they're ready for the tasks required to write sophisticated essays. It's not necessary to have them start with three paragraphs and then progress to four or five. The length of a composition should be determined by its topic and content. 

Be sure to spend a lot of time developing a TO with the whole class following the sequence illustrated in Exhibit 9.3. As with the SPO, outlines don't

necessarily have to be converted into drafts.

**Exhibit 9.3**

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING A TO**

1. Select a topic and identify the purpose of the composition. 

2. Write the thesis statement. 

3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the TO, with the abbreviation T.S. 

as a reminder to write a topic sentence. 

4. Write the details supporting the main idea in the right-hand column for each body paragraph. Use keywords, phrases, abbreviations, and symbols on the dotted lines. 

5. Write the concluding statement. 

Each step in this sequence is discussed in the following sections. 

**1. Selecting a Topic and Identifying the Purpose**

Students must know a topic well before they'll be able to create a TO about it. Book reports, current events related to scientific or geographic issues, and biographies are all good topics. 

The teacher, not the student, should select the topic for the TO, and—at least at first—all students should be writing on the same topic. Students will need practice before they can identify a topic on their own that's appropriate for a composition—one that's neither too narrow nor too broad. The Civil War, for example, is too broad, and a discussion of a specific minor battle might be too narrow. A review of the military career of Ulysses S. 

Grant or an analysis of the Battle of Gettysburg would work better. 

Although students at higher grade levels will be writing about more complex topics, they should not be expected to engage in independent research while learning how to construct a TO. That would impose too great a burden on working memory. 

After the topic has been chosen, guide students in identifying the purpose and the type of the composition. Will it be an expository, narrative, descriptive, or opinion essay? More advanced writers can combine these structures, but less experienced writers should stick to a single one. For background on these different types of essays, see the discussion in Chapter 5. 

**2. Developing a Thesis Statement**

A **thesis statement** is **a statement that conveys the main theme of the entire composition**—just as a topic sentence conveys the main idea of a single paragraph. A thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence at the top of the TO. **The thesis statement and concluding** **statement are the only complete sentences on the TO. **

Constructing a thesis statement requires that students understand the main points they will be making in a composition and the text structure they will adopt. At the same time, they'll need to be able to state their thesis in a single sentence—and one that is not too detailed. 

Tyrell wrote a thesis statement that may remind you of sentences composed by your own students:

***In this essay, I am going to tell you about the many effects of the Civil War*****. **

Tyrell reveals his topic, but it is not obvious exactly what he is going to tell us. 

Students may benefit from a thesis statement that explicitly outlines a **plan of development**. This means that the thesis statement presents the main points of the composition in the order in which they will be addressed in the composition. The plan of development provides a clear road map for the rest of the outline. 

With guidance, Tyrell rewrote his statement to include a plan of development:

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

Exhibit 9.4 is a TO showing Tyrell's thesis statement with a plan of development:  *economic*, *social*, *political*. Tyrell's thesis statement signals to the reader that the next paragraph of the essay will focus on the economic effects of the Civil War. Then there will be a paragraph on the social effects, and finally a paragraph on the political effects.

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**



**Exhibit 9.4**

When your students are first learning to create thesis statements, tell them they can draw on the three strategies for creating topic sentences that they've already learned:

**Statement:**

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

**Subordinating conjunction:**

***Although the Civil War lasted only four years, its impacts on the economic, social, and political structures of the United***

***States were enormous*****. **

**Appositive:**

***The Civil War, a turning point in the country's history, had major economic, social, and political effects*****. **

Students may choose not to include a plan of development, in which case they can experiment with different structures. For example, a thesis statement could simply say:

***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency marked the beginning of the United tates as a world power*****. **

The essay could then address the specifics—the Panama Canal, the Roosevelt Corollary—contained in that general idea. 

You may find it helpful to provide students with examples of different approaches they can use when developing their thesis statements: **A personal judgment:**

***It is urgent that problems associated with rising sea levels as a result of climate change be addressed worldwide*****. **

**Advice or directions:**

***There are several strategies to combat the effect of rising sea levels*****. **

**A statement of consequences (cause and effect):**

***If climate change is not addressed globally, coastal cities will be in danger*****. **

**An interpretation (usually of fiction or poetry):**

***John Knowles's widely read coming-of-age novel, A Separate Peace, presents themes of friendship, envy, and the effect of***

***social class on relationships*****. **

**Compare and contrast:**

***There are significant differences between the candidates regarding their positions on education*****. **

Even without a plan of development, students will be able to refer back to their thesis statement to stay on track. Every paragraph in the composition should relate to the theme contained in the thesis statement. 

**3. Developing the Main Idea Boxes**

The column on the left side of the TO is headed “Main Idea.” The Main Idea boxes are for words or phrases indicating the topic of each paragraph. 

Unlike the SPO, the TO does not require students to write out the topic sentences for their paragraphs. However, it can be helpful to have them write the abbreviation T.S. in each Main Idea box to remind them to include topic sentences for each paragraph when they compose their drafts. 

Listing the main ideas in the left-hand boxes helps students avoid repetition and ensures that each paragraph relates to the composition's overall theme. 

Different types of compositions call for different kinds of main ideas for the body paragraphs, as you can see from the following examples. The order and number of the paragraphs also will depend on the type of assignment.

**4. Developing the Details**

The Details boxes are on the right side of the outline. These boxes have dotted lines where students write notes using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols that will form the basis of their body paragraphs. Students should have sufficient background knowledge to provide at least three details for each paragraph. 

**Make sure students understand that they should write the details for each paragraph in note form rather than in full sentences. **

Although students need to settle on the order of the paragraphs when creating the TO, the order of the details may not matter at this point. Students can revise their outlines or change the order of the details when it's time to write their drafts. 

**5. Writing the Concluding Statement**

The function of a concluding statement is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. A concluding statement usually does one of the following:

Summarize

Offer a solution or recommendation

Pose a question

Justify a position

Present a point of view

Here are some examples of possible concluding statements, along with thesis statements for the same essays:

**EXAMPLE 1:**

**Thesis statement:**

***The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations*****. **

**Concluding statement (summary):**

***In summary, the impact of the Civil War was felt for many years after the fighting ended*****. **

**EXAMPLE 2:**

**Thesis statement:**

***If climate change is not addressed worldwide, coastal cities will be in danger*****. **

**Concluding statement (solution or recommendation):**

***To conclude, nations must work together to prevent rising sea levels from causing widespread destruction*****. **

**EXAMPLE 3:**

**Thesis statement:**

***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency saw the development of the national parks*****. **

**Concluding statement:**

***One of Theodore Roosevelt's most important legacies was his approach to conservation*****. **



Students do not need to write concluding sentences for each paragraph in a multiple-paragraph composition. 

**Using a Transition Outline to Write an Essay**

Converting a TO into a draft should be an efficient process. Students will know what their topic is, the basics of what they want to say, and the order in which they want to say it. In the drafting and revising process, they can devote their mental energy to crafting clear, interesting, and varied sentences—including topic sentences for their body paragraphs—and using transitions to create a coherent and effective composition. 

When students revise their drafts, the benefits of continuing to work on sentence-level activities alongside lengthier writing become clear. Those activities will continue to help students remember to apply strategies like varying their sentence structure and including information their intended audience might need. Students may also need to cite evidence from texts and incorporate quotations. 

**Using Transitions to Link Paragraphs**

Transitions enhance coherence and flow in longer pieces of writing. When your students are converting TOs into drafts of compositions and revising them, remind them to use transitions to link one paragraph to the next. Virtually any of the transitions they've learned to connect sentences can also be used to connect paragraphs. See Appendix C, “Transition Words and Phrases.” 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

For example, if a student is writing a compare-and-contrast composition about red and white blood cells and she has written one paragraph about red

blood cells and the next about white blood cells, she can use a change-of-direction transition to create a link between the two paragraphs: *Red blood cells carry respiratory gases throughout the body. These cells lack a nucleus, which means that there is room inside each cell for more* *of a pigment called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their color and is responsible for carrying oxygen around the body. Red blood* *cells also transport carbon dioxide*. 

***On the other hand**, white blood cells fight infection. These cells circulate throughout the bloodstream and tissues to attack unknown* *organisms that may cause an illness or injury. Unlike red blood cells, white blood cells have a nucleus*. 

**Incorporating Quotations**

When students begin to write longer compositions, they are often encouraged not just to cite evidence from texts but also to quote from them directly. When students are creating outlines, they should be taught how to include the page number(s) and source(s) of the quotation(s) they plan to use. If they are using more than one source, they will need to include the author as well. 

Too frequently, students will use a quotation without providing any context, introduction, or attribution. In addition, it's often not clear why students have chosen a particular quotation. They may assume its meaning and relevance are obvious, or they may not have fully understood the words themselves. At times it seems that students are inserting a quotation simply to prove they've read the text rather than to support the point they're making. 

If you want your students to use quotations effectively, you have to show them how to be judicious about selecting the text they want to quote and how to incorporate that text smoothly into their own writing. They'll need to answer these questions:

*What does the quotation mean? *

*Whose words are they? *

*How does the quotation support the point I'm making? *

**Understanding the Quotation**

To ensure that students actually understand the words they're quoting, ask them to paraphrase the quotation for you. For example: Quotation: *“Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere.” *

Paraphrased quotation: *No matter where suffering happens and who is affected, it has an impact everywhere and on everyone*. 

Once they've done that, students should make sure they know the source of the quotation and whether that source or speaker is reliable. Then they can ask themselves if the quotation belongs in the spot where they're intending to use it. If it does, they can include the source of the quotation and page number on an appropriate detail line of their TO. 

**Determining What's Noteworthy**

It's helpful to explain to students that a longer quote isn't always a better quote. A succinct phrase may have more impact than a discussion that goes on for several lines. 

Nor is it always necessary for students to include a direct quotation. Paraphrasing text often works just as well. However, even if a quotation is paraphrased, students should include an attribution to the text on which it's based. 

Quotations should be reserved for instances when the author of the text has said something particularly noteworthy. Consider guiding your students in identifying those distinctive quotations before they attempt to select them independently. 

**Weaving In Quotations**

Once they've settled on a quotation that is on point and worthy of inclusion, students will need to learn how to weave it into their own writing. 

The book *They Say/I Say*2 suggests introducing quotations using phrases like these:

*Jones states, “* ____________________________________________.” 

*As the author of the article argues, “* _____________________________.” 

*According to Jones, “* _______________________________________.” 

The authors also suggest following up the quotation with an explanation that paraphrases it. For example, 

*In other words, Jones is saying* ________________________________. 

*Therefore, according to the author, * _____________________________. 

*Jones's point is that* ________________________________________. 

**Level 1 Example**

*According to Helen Keller, “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.” *

*Her point was that even though she was blind and deaf, she was still able to experience the most meaningful parts of life*. 

**Level 2 Example**

More advanced students may be quoting from primary sources or historical documents, and this is when setting up and paraphrasing quotations is particularly important. It won't always be clear to a reader where the quotation is from and—especially if the language is complex or archaic—what it means. 

*The Declaration of Independence states, “But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a* *design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for* *their future security.” In other words, revolution is justified only when the government has carried out a sustained and deliberate campaign* *against the rights of the people*. 

**TEACHER TIP**

Emphasize to your students the importance of citations and attribution when they use quotations in their writing. Quotations should be set off by quotation marks or, if lengthy, be indented as a block quote. Older students can be introduced to the various ways to cite sources, such as footnotes, endnotes, and in-text. It's best to demonstrate just one form of documentation, preferably the MLA, 3 APA,4 or

Chicago/Turabian5 formats. 

The example in Exhibit 9.5 assumes students have learned about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

**The MPO for Level 2 Students**

If your Level 2 students have already had practice with the TO, most of the steps involved in creating the MPO will be familiar. 

If they haven't had that practice, guide them through these activities, all of which are described in detail in the previous section:

**OUTLINING**

Select a topic and identify the purpose. 

Develop a thesis statement. 

Fill in the Main Idea boxes. 

Fill in the Details boxes. 

Write a concluding statement. 

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

Use transitions to link paragraphs. 

Incorporate quotations. 

A significant difference between the TO and the MPO is that instead of writing a thesis statement as a stand-alone sentence, students will now create a multi-sentence introductory paragraph composed of a thesis statement as well as general and specific statements. The same is true for a concluding paragraph. This process often requires a good deal of guidance and practice. 

Constructing an MPO involves six steps. The sequence of the steps corresponds to the numbers that appear on the sample MPO template in Exhibit

9.6. MPOs can have three, four, five, or more paragraphs. As we noted earlier, students don't have to start with three-paragraph MPOs and then progress to longer ones. The number of paragraphs assigned should depend on the topic and the content. 

As with the SPO and TO, you should spend a lot of time developing MPOs with the whole class before expecting students to develop an MPO

independently.

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING AN MPO**

1. Select a topic and identify the composition's purpose. 

2. Develop the thesis statement as a complete sentence on the solid line at the top of the outline. Tell students that this is the only time they'll write a complete sentence on the MPO. 

3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the MPO and include T.S. as a reminder to create a topic sentence later when drafting. 

4. Write the supporting details for each main idea in the Details boxes in the right-hand column of the MPO. 

5. Indicate the structure of the introductory paragraph by writing the letters *G* (for *general* statement), *S* (for *specific* statement), and *T* (for *thesis* statement). The statements themselves should be created only after the outline is done. 

6. For the concluding paragraph, invert the order of the introduction to *T*, *S*, and *G*. 

Steps 1–4 have been described previously, but steps 5 and 6 are new and specific to the MPO. The next section will define GST and TSG and describe the process of using them as a guide to develop introductions and conclusions. 

**Using the MPO to Draft and Revise Compositions**

Converting an MPO to a draft is more challenging than undertaking that process with a TO because students will need to create general and specific statements during the drafting process. They will need ample practice with the preparatory activities described in this section. 

Don't forget that students should use transition words and phrases to connect their paragraphs and smoothly incorporate quotations, as discussed previously in this chapter. 

## Introductions: The GST Structure

Introductions set forth the topic of the composition and should engage the reader's interest. Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs requires the ability to summarize information and make generalizations at an even more sophisticated level than that required for writing only the thesis statement. 

Both introductory and concluding paragraphs should consist of at least three sentences. In addition to the thesis statement, students will also need to learn how to construct general and specific statements that support their thesis. This process, which is described in *The St. Martin's Handbook*, 6 will result in coherent paragraphs that provide context for the thesis statement. 

Some teachers may believe that the GST format makes students' introductions too formulaic. But the fact is that most developing writers actually need and appreciate a formula to help them structure coherent introductions and conclusions. We have seen this technique applied in sophisticated essays written by experienced writers. 

According to the handbook, introductory paragraphs should unfold in this order:

1. First sentence: general statement ( *G*)

***There are books that were written decades ago that are relevant today because of their timely themes*****. **

2. Second sentence: specific statement ( *S*)

***The Great Gatsby has fascinated readers over the years because of its focus on extreme wealth, unbridled materialism, ***

***and the decay of social and moral values*****. **

3. Third sentence: thesis statement ( *T*)

***Although the book was published in 1925, the characters, the setting, and the conflicts resonate with present-day readers*****. **

Using the GST format can be challenging. Even students who have had experience crafting thesis statements may need support in coming up with general and specific statements. One way to provide that support is to model or guide them through the process. 

**GST: Classroom Example**

Using the topic of Nelson Mandela, whom the class had been studying, Ms. Jackson began by asking her tenth graders to come up with a **thesis** **statement** about him. After some discussion, the class agreed on the following:

***Nelson Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black***

***president*****. **

After completing the Main Idea and Details boxes for the composition with the whole class, Ms. Jackson asked the students what general category of individuals they thought Mandela belonged to. One student said, “freedom fighters”; another said, “civil rights activists”; and a third suggested

“people who had a big effect on history.” Ms. Jackson chose the third phrasing, and collectively the class wrote:

***During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history*****. **

Ms. Jackson told the class that could be their **general statement**. Now, she said, it was time to narrow the focus to come up with a more **specific** **statement**, perhaps by placing Mandela in a particular place. The students came up with “South Africa.” Ms. Jackson asked them to try writing a specific statement using an appositive. After comparing their different formulations, the class agreed on this one:

***Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa*****. **

The class then put all three sentences together to form an introductory paragraph using the GST format:

***During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history. Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle***

***for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa. Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition***

***of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black president*****. **

Here are two additional examples of introductory paragraphs that follow the GST format. The words in bold indicate elements of the plans of development that are embedded in the thesis statements. 



## BOOK REPORT

**[G]** Only a few of the countless books published each year become classics. **[S]** William Golding's novel about a group of British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash has been required reading in many schools for decades. **[T]** *Lord of the Flies* has intrigued readers because of its **plot, characters, ** and **the lessons** that can be learned from this compelling tale. 

**SIGNIFICANT EVENT**

**[G]** All of the great presidents have a signature achievement that profoundly affected future generations. **[S]** The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France is considered by many to be Thomas Jefferson's outstanding accomplishment. **[T]** As a result of the Louisiana Purchase, he significantly **increased the size of the United States, extended its borders, ** and **opened up new trade routes. **

**Writing General, Specific, and Thesis Statements**

The amount of time you spend teaching your students how to develop general, specific, and thesis statements will vary depending on their abilities and the complexity of the content they're studying. 

The following kinds of activities should be modeled and practiced frequently with the entire class before you have students try them independently. 

The following activities are listed in the sequence in which they should be introduced. 

**1. Write a Thesis Statement (T) When Given a Topic**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a thesis statement (T) for the given topic. 

**TOPIC:** Napoleon's impact

T: ***Napoleon's impact on France had both positive and negative aspects*****. **

**2. Distinguish among General (G), Specific (S), and Thesis (T) Statements**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the general statement, specific statement, and thesis statement by writing G, S, or T. 

*** S *** In 1936, an athlete impressed spectators at the Berlin Olympics with his skill and talent. 

*** T *** Jesse Owens, a formidable Black track and field star, is remembered for shattering world records. 



*** G *** Many Olympians have made a significant impact on their sport. 



**3. Write an S When Given a G and a T**

If students are having trouble coming up with a specific statement, you can suggest that they try answering one or more of the question words ( *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how*). Another good option is to include an appositive. The following example assumes students have read the book *Lyddie*. 7

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a specific statement (S) for the given general statement (G) and thesis statement (T). 

G: People often have different ideas of how to define “fairness.” 

S: ***Diana and Lyddie, two characters in Katherine Paterson's novel Lyddie, have differing points of view*****. **

T: Although Diana is radical and tries to entice other factory workers to sign a petition, Lyddie does not agree with Diana's perspective until the very end of the novel. 

**4. Write a G and an S When Given a T**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a general statement (G) and a specific statement (S) for the given thesis statement (T). 

G: ***An invasive species is an organism that is not native to a particular area*****. **

S: ***In the Florida everglades, the Burmese python has been wreaking havoc on native animal populations since it***

***was first introduced to the area in 1994*****. **

T: Although these enormous reptiles continue to pose a problem for this once-thriving ecosystem, scientists in Florida are developing methods to reduce their numbers. 

**5. Adding Sentences to the Introductory Paragraph**

As students become more proficient, there is no need to limit their introductions to three sentences. Typically, the fourth or fifth sentences are specific statements, often facts or statistics. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write an additional specific statement (S). 

G: As the United States grew in industrial and economic power, two controversial figures emerged. 

S: By the end of the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie controlled almost the entire steel industry and John Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company controlled 90% of the refining business. 

S: ***Both men made tremendous philanthropic contributions that made them heroic in the views of many*****. **

T: However, there have been debates about whether these early builders of big business in America should be considered “robber barons” 

or “captains of industry.” 

**Crafting Conclusions**

As with the concluding statement in the TO, the function of the concluding paragraph in the MPO is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. It should accomplish at least one of the same goals as the TO concluding statement, such as offering a summary, solution, or recommendation. 

The structure of the concluding paragraph reverses the structure of the introductory one: instead of GST, the concluding paragraph follows a TSG

pattern. The thesis statement should be rephrased and positioned as the first sentence instead of the last. 

Consider these examples of an introduction and conclusion following the GST and TSG formats on the topic of the monarch butterfly. 

**INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:**

*The migration of the monarch butterfly has always been fascinating to scientists. However, there are both habitat and environmental factors* *that pose threats to this favorite flying insect. Even though historically the monarch butterfly population has come back from challenges that* *have threatened its existence, recovering from the use of pesticides, climate change, and development may be more problematic*. 

**CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH:**

*Although monarch butterflies have bounced back from past threats caused by nature, the hazards caused by people may be too monumental for* *this popular butterfly population to overcome. Concerns about the future of the monarch are valid and serious. It is imperative to address the* *dangers confronting this remarkable butterfly before it becomes extinct*. 

Remind students that the last words in a composition usually have the most impact on the reader; therefore, the concluding paragraph should contain its key points. After the first sentence, which will be the rephrased thesis statement, students should write specific and general statements that differ from the ones they used in their introductory paragraph. Both should expand on the S and G statements that appear there. If students are having trouble rephrasing the three types of statements in their conclusions, you can provide them with some sample introductory paragraphs and have them practice reconstructing them as concluding paragraphs.

**Title:**

**Two Primary Causes of the American Revolution**

*The factors that led to the American Revolution have been described by countless historians. There were multiple events that played a role* *in the colonists' rebellion, but two are especially important. The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were crucial in the decision to declare* *war on Great Britain*. 

*In 1774, the British wanted to make an example of Massachusetts after the Boston Tea Party. As a result, the Intolerable Acts, a group of* *four acts, were passed. They denied Massachusetts the right to govern itself. In addition, Boston Harbor was blockaded, and fair trials* *were prevented. Finally, the last act applied to all the colonies, not just Massachusetts. British troops were ordered to be stationed at more* *convenient locations and the expenses were to be paid by the colonies*. 

*In 1765, the Stamp Act was intended to raise money from the colonists by taxing all printed paper, even playing cards, but it was enacted* *without the approval of their assemblies. The colonists believed they should have the same rights as the English. Patrick Henry's* *publication attacking the act, Virginia Resolves, was widely read. The phrase “taxation without representation” became popular*. 

*The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were primary reasons for the American Revolution. As a result of the burdens these acts placed on* *the colonists, their fury grew. Their anger eventually led to a strong desire for independence from Great Britain*.

**Differentiating TO and MPO Activities**

Practice in any of the preceding activities can help students who are having difficulty with particular elements of the TO and MPO. Here are some further suggestions you can use for additional support:

TO: Provide students with the thesis and concluding statement(s). 

TO and MPO: Provide students with the thesis statement and words and phrases for the Main Idea column to help them organize their paragraphs. 

TO and MPO: Provide students with both a main idea and details for the first body paragraph. 

MPO: Provide Level 2 students who are ready for the MPO with a thesis statement and/or the general or specific statements to use in their introduction and conclusion. 



**Adapting the TO and MPO: The Pre-Transition Outline**

For students, particularly those in elementary school, who are not ready for the TO or MPO formats, we suggest using a hybrid of an SPO and TO, the Pre-Transition Outline (PTO), to help them begin thinking about the requirements of MPOs and essays. As with the TO, for the PTO students select the topic first and then develop a thesis statement. In contrast to the TO, on the PTO students write out a full topic sentence for each paragraph as they would on an SPO; however, they do not need to add a concluding sentence for each paragraph. Instead, the PTO ends with a concluding statement that paraphrases the thesis statement. 

It's best if the PTO is only two or three paragraphs long and has three or four details. The fourth detail is in parentheses to indicate that it is considered optional depending on the topic. See the following example of a completed PTO. (Also see Appendix J.)

**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)  *Appendix J*

When students have mastered completing the PTO and developing drafts based on it, move right on to the TO. It's preferable to have students become accustomed to the TO sooner rather than later because, together with the MPO, those formats will be more beneficial to students as they write longer essays about more complex and detailed topics.

**Research Papers**

Teaching students effective research skills is challenging but important. If students haven't learned how to research a topic, they may find themselves investing a lot of effort in a project that relies on information that is questionable or just plain wrong. 

It's all too easy for students to stumble on a website that looks reliable but is riddled with misinformation. Students may also mistake personal opinions they find online for fact or become overwhelmed by the amount of information available. 

Make sure your students are staying on track over the days or weeks that they're working on their projects. Once students have their topics, it's best to set up a detailed schedule listing due dates for each stage of the process: gathering material, developing a thesis, coming up with a bibliography, taking and organizing notes, and so on. We suggest that you require students to get your approval for each section before moving on to the next step. 

A full discussion of how to help your students do research online is beyond the scope of this book, but we can offer a few suggestions. We also recommend consulting the article *“* The Challenge That's Bigger than Fake News: Civic Reasoning in a Social Media Environment,” published in *American Educator* magazine and authored by a group of researchers at Stanford University. 8

**Surfing the Internet—with Guardrails**

Model the process of searching online for the class, just as you model TWR strategies and activities. Tell students that when they look for information and evidence on the internet, it's important to be aware of the following guidelines and search suggestions, which are drawn from the aforementioned *American Educator* article as well as an article in *Education Week* on teaching online research skills:9

Use precise keywords in online searches. Typing *Kennedy assassination* might return results about the assassinations of both John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy instead of just one of them. 

Use certain words and symbols to refine online searches. 

Use quotation marks around search terms to get the exact wording. 

Insert “AND” between search terms to produce results that focus on both subjects. 

Include a space followed by a minus sign to eliminate a particular meaning of a term (for example, a student searching for information about the Australian Outback could type *Outback -car* to eliminate results relating to the Outback vehicle). 

Check whether a website's URL ends in *.com*, *.gov*, or *.edu*. Websites connected with a government agency ( *.gov*) or university ( *.edu*) are generally more trustworthy than someone's personal website. But warn students that *.org*, previously associated with mission-driven organizations, is no longer a sign of reliability; practically any organization can now obtain that designation. 

Evaluate websites with a critical eye. Students should be asking questions such as: Who wrote this? What is his or her perspective? Who is sponsoring this site? Are there links and references to other sources that corroborate the information? Asking these questions while on the site itself may not be enough. It can be more useful to leave the site and see what other sources say about it. 

Don't click on the first result that comes up after a Google search. It's best to go down the list and examine URLs and the sentences that accompany each result for clues to reliability. 

Use Wikipedia wisely. Although many educators warn students away from the site, it can be useful if you know how to use it. Students should learn to investigate Wikipedia's “Talk” pages, where they'll find debates on controversial issues, and to use the references at the end of each article as resources for lateral reading. 

Ms. Hamilton was right: her fifth graders didn't do well on their written responses for the state test. But the following year, she tried a different approach. She taught her students sentence-level strategies as well as how to create the SPO and TO. 

In the spring, as in previous years, she wanted to do what she could to prepare her students for the writing prompts they would see on the state test. They would probably still have to deal with unfamiliar content in the reading passages. But, she hoped, at least they would now have writing skills that would help them produce coherent responses. 

The day before testing began, she gave them a text to read about space exploration—a topic they hadn't learned about in class. “Based on this article,” she wrote on the board, “what are the most significant challenges to exploring outer space?” Then she handed out blank sheets of paper. 

Almost all of her students got right to work. But they didn't just start writing. First, they created outlines without a template, identifying the topic and writing a thesis statement below it, using the prompt on the board as a guide. 

Most wrote some version of “There are several significant challenges to exploring outer space,” but some outlined a plan of development. A boy named Malik, for example, wrote, “The most significant challenges to exploring outer space are radiation, the lack of gravity, and the distance from Earth.” 

Then students drew boxes for main ideas and details and began filling them in. Once they had their concluding statements at the bottom, they were off and running, converting their outlines into drafts. 

Ms. Hamilton felt a wave of relief wash over her. This year, when her students saw a writing prompt on the test, she was pretty sure they wouldn't just flail or freeze. They would know what to do. 

**To Sum Up**

Before trying to create TOs, students need ample experience developing topic sentences, writing supporting details in note form, and constructing coherent paragraphs. 

Level 1 and less advanced Level 2 students should initially use these skills to create simple three- or four-paragraph TOs for book reports, biographies, and compositions on scientific or geographic topics. 

Introduce students to the TO or MPO by modeling the process of creating one. 

When students are still learning to create TOs and MPOs, you should assign the topics; for more experienced students, you should provide guidance in selecting a topic. 

Provide students with models of thesis statements that fit the type of TO or MPO they're constructing, and, when appropriate, have them include a plan of development that maps out the structure of the composition. 

Have students fill in the Main Idea and corresponding Details boxes for each paragraph of the TO and MPO in note form. 

To prepare Level 2 students to write introductory paragraphs for the MPO, introduce them to the GST formula—incorporating general, specific, and thesis statements—and have them practice distinguishing among the three types of statements and then creating them. 

Have students reverse the formula to TSG for the conclusion. 

Have students convert their completed TOs and MPOs to drafts and then revise them by varying sentence structure, incorporating quotations (if any), and using transitions to link paragraphs and sentences. 

If Level 2 students' MPOs require independent research, have students commit to a schedule with deadlines for each step of the process.

## CHAPTER 10

**Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays**

Ms. Giannelli was familiar with the state writing standards that applied to her seventh graders. She knew they needed to be able to write arguments in which they supported their claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence, while acknowledging another point of view. 

After searching online for argumentative writing prompts, Ms. Giannelli found a wealth of ideas for middle schoolers. She decided to give her class a choice of just three topics:

Should cell phones be allowed at school? 

Should students have homework on weekends? 

Should exotic animals be kept in captivity? 

Ms. Giannelli knew her students had lots of opinions on the first two questions, and she suspected the third one would appeal to the animal lovers in the class. To help them get started on a topic they might not know much about, she provided the two sentences that had accompanied the prompt online: “Many exotic animals live longer in captivity. However, many people argue that it's not a good way of life for them.” 

Ms. Giannelli was pleased to see that as students chose their topics, there was a buzz of excitement in the air. After about half an hour, she decided to check their progress. 

Some students seemed to have gotten stuck after the first sentence or two—especially those who had chosen to write about animals in captivity. Most were against the idea, but they had trouble coming up with reasons beyond their conviction that the animals would be unhappy. 

Students who chose one of the other topics had produced more prose, but it wasn't what Ms. Giannelli had hoped for. Ari's essay was pretty typical. She took a strong stand against homework on weekends. But her reasons were entirely personal. She explained how tired she was after school on Fridays and listed all the activities she would like to engage in during a typical weekend. Ms. Giannelli didn't think these reasons counted as “evidence.” Nor did Ari acknowledge that anyone else might think homework on weekends was a good idea, let alone raise the arguments such a person might make and try to rebut them. 

The standards were clear, and it was equally clear Ms. Giannelli's students weren't equipped to meet them. What wasn't clear was what she could do about that. 

Teachers frequently assign opinion and argumentative essays to satisfy the requirements of state writing standards. Children as young as third grade are expected to present their claims and convince a reader of their point of view. By sixth grade, they're supposed to be supporting their claims with evidence, and by seventh grade they should be acknowledging arguments on the other side. As we have discovered, even older students often struggle to write these kinds of essays if they haven't learned the appropriate language and structures. 

When you have students practice the skills leading up to argumentative writing, choose a topic that has two debatable sides. Whenever possible, the topic should be embedded in the content students are studying. Often opinion or argumentative writing is treated as a separate category that can be addressed only by having students take and defend positions on topics beyond the school curriculum—such as the pros and cons of school uniforms. 

However, choosing a topic they've been studying is an ideal way to build and deepen their knowledge of content. Stay alert for topics in the curriculum, at whatever grade level you're teaching, that lend themselves to pro/con writing. For example, students can write about the pros and cons of traveling west in covered wagons, the strengths and weaknesses or flaws in a particular book or character, or arguments for and against using atomic bombs to attack Japan in World War II. 

If you've been using TWR's method, your students have already been building the skills they'll need to craft effective arguments: Completing sentence stems using *because*, *but*, and *so* develops students' ability to connect a **claim** to evidence, introduce a **counterclaim,** and describe cause/effect relationships. 

Using subordinating conjunctions such as *while* and *although* and transitions such as *however* and *on the other hand* to begin sentences enables students to acknowledge or make a claim while simultaneously bringing in an opposing claim. 

Sentence expansion using a kernel that takes a position develops students' ability to state a claim. 

Transitions present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims. 

Creating topic sentences and thesis statements enables students to identify the main points they want to make in an argument. 

Summarizing develops students' ability to succinctly describe claims on both sides. 

Creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs that are either pro or con), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs) helps students logically organize claims and evidence. 

Incorporating quotations and paraphrases during the revision process teaches students how to cite evidence for claims in an effective way. 

As we emphasize throughout this book, however, these strategies will help students write well only if they have knowledge of what they're writing about. That applies to argumentative writing as much as to any other genre. 

**Preparing for Argumentative Writing**

Often students approach argumentative writing by progressing along three types of paragraphs and compositions:

**Opinion:** Author tries to convince a reader to adopt a certain point of view; opinion writing is the easiest and is generally assigned to elementary students. 

**Pro/con:** Author lays out two sides of an issue and presents the evidence to support each side but doesn't take a position. 

**Argumentative:** Author presents the evidence for both sides but also decides which position has more merit and defends the one he supports. 

Opinion and pro/con writing assignments constitute a scaffold leading to the argumentative essay—the most challenging of these three types of writing. In writing opinion pieces, younger students get practice listing reasons that support a claim. When crafting body paragraphs of a pro/con essay, students learn to state opposing positions and present evidence that supports each one. If they actually agree with one side rather than the other, they get practice suspending their own opinions and putting themselves in the shoes of someone on the other side—a skill that will serve them well when they turn to argumentative writing and need to summarize an opposing viewpoint fairly. 

**WHY PRACTICE WRITING OPINION, PRO/CON, AND ARGUMENTATIVE PIECES? **

Develops analytical and logical thinking skills

Helps students distinguish reliable sources from unreliable ones

Improves organizational skills

Teaches students to cite textual evidence effectively

Develops the ability to assess and rank stronger and weaker arguments

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Planning and outlining before writing a draft of any of these essay types deepens and reinforces students' understanding of content. Moreover, as with other outline strategies, these benefits will accrue whether or not students create a finished product. 

**Sentence‐Level Activities: Laying the Foundation for Arguments**

To prepare your students for the challenges of writing argumentative essays, you can give them sentence-level activities that will introduce some of the techniques they'll ultimately use for that type of writing. The conjunction, transition, and sentence expansion activities that follow will also deepen students' comprehension of the curriculum content in which they're embedded and spur them to think analytically about what they've learned. 

**Using Conjunctions to Present a Position**

The following examples illustrate how conjunction activities can introduce students to the idea of identifying evidence that supports claims. 

When students use *because*, they need to find evidence that supports the proposition given in the sentence stem. When they use *so*, they need to consider what action people should take as a result of that evidence. As always, using the conjunction *but* may be more challenging because students need to come up with opposing evidence—laying the foundation for pro/con, and, eventually, argumentative writing. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Weather forecasts can be helpful because ***people need to prepare for different conditions***. 

Weather forecasts can be helpful, but ***they are not always accurate*****. **

Weather forecasts can be helpful, so ***it is important to check them regularly*****. **



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture because ***they can be engineered to resist pests, tolerate***

***harsh conditions, and increase crop yields*****. **

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, but ***there are concerns about their impact on biodiversity, ***

***their potential health risks, and the ethics of genetic manipulation*****. **

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, so ***it's important to conduct ongoing research and establish***

***regulations to ensure their safe and responsible use*****. **

**Using Transitions to Introduce and Support Claims**

A transition may begin a sentence, thus creating a link between that sentence and the one that precedes it, or link thoughts within a sentence. When used at the beginning or end of a paragraph, transitions can underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph's various sentences together. And, of course, transitions can and should be used judiciously to connect the paragraphs in a multiple-paragraph essay. These functions are explained in more detail in Chapter 9. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

All five categories of transition words and phrases can be helpful in presenting and evaluating reasons, evidence, and claims (see Appendix C). 

Students can learn to use the following types of transitions:

**Time-and-sequence** transitions such as *in addition*, *moreover*, and *finally* to list reasons and claims on each side **Illustration** transitions such as *for example* and *specifically* to provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence **Emphasis** transitions such as *most important*, *moreover*, or *certainly* to highlight the most important claims or underscore an argument **Change-of-direction** transitions such as *however*, *although*, and *in contrast* to introduce or acknowledge opposing claims **Conclusion** transitions such as *thus* or *in the end* to signal that they're wrapping up an argument Change-of-direction transitions are particularly useful for introducing a contrasting point, example, or argument. They can come in the middle of sentences, as with *but*, or at the beginning of a new sentence, as with *however*. When one paragraph is devoted to a claim and the next to a counterclaim, tell your students they can introduce the second paragraph with a change-of-direction transition such as *on the other hand*. 

Another type of change-of-direction transition—the subordinating conjunction—is particularly useful for thesis statements in pro/con or argumentative essays. If students begin their thesis statements with words such as *although* and *while*, they'll be able to acknowledge two opposing claims. They'll also be able to avoid using the first person ( *I believe*), which can detract from the authority of their argument. 

**Using Sentence Expansion to Build Argumentative Skills**

Another sentence-level activity that can be adapted to build argumentative skills is sentence expansion. Remember that sentence expansion involves giving students a kernel sentence—a simple, active, declarative sentence with only one verb—along with the question words to help them expand it. 

To make sentence expansion into an argumentative activity, make the kernel sentence you give students one that takes a position. This example is embedded in content from the book *Flowers for Algernon*:1

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 



His life greatly improved. 



Who? ***Charlie***

When? ***after experimental surgery***

Why? ***intelligence***** ↑**



**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After the experimental surgery, Charlie's life greatly improved because his intelligence***

***increased*****. **

Then you might also give them a kernel that takes the opposite position. For example:

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 



His quality of life declined. 



Who? ***Charlie***

When? ***after experimental surgery***

Why? ***lost friends → lonely***



**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After the experimental surgery, Charlie's quality of life declined because he lost his friends and***

***became lonely*****. **

**Using Sentence‐Level Activities Together**

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole's second-grade class had been reading about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos as opposed to their natural habitats. To help students understand the debate and work on their writing skills, Ms. Cole gave them sentence stems that required them to supply a logical or evidence-based reason to support the pro-zoo side and explain what followed from that position:

Zoos are good for animals because ***they protect endangered species from extinction*****. **

Zoos are good for animals, so ***people should continue to support them*****. **

Since many zoos educate visitors about conservation, ***people learn to respect the environment*****. **

Then she made the activity more challenging by asking them to consider arguments on the other side:

Zoos are not good for animals because ***animals should not be removed from their native habitats*****. **

Zoos are not good for animals, so ***they should not be supported by the public*****. **

Since many zoos keep animals in unsafe conditions, ***animals develop health problems*****. **

Finally, Ms. Cole asked her students to summarize both positions without taking a side:

Although some people believe that zoos help certain species survive, ***others argue that animals should not be held captive*****. **

Next Ms. Cole wanted her students to practice using transition words between sentences. Although the students weren't yet ready to write pro/con paragraphs about zoos, she wanted them to have experience creating the kinds of connections between thoughts that they would need to use during the drafting and revising stages. 

Ms. Cole gave her students pairs of sentences that had no transition words connecting them. The students needed to choose an appropriate transition word for each pair and write it in the blank. To provide additional support, Ms. Cole provided a word bank of transition words for her students to choose from. Initially, she gave them sentences that only required them to take one side, either pro or con, like this: If zoos are closed, many animal species may become extinct. 

***For example, *** the numbers of wild gorillas and elephants have decreased because of poachers. 



Zoos have improved over the years. ***As a result, *** animals live longer in them and are healthier. 

Then she introduced transitions that required students to offer contrasting evidence, laying the groundwork for pro/con and argumentative writing: Some people believe zoos can be good for animals. On the other hand, ***critics say that animals have better lives in the wild*****. **

**Level 2 Example**

When his Level 2 history class was studying the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Hidalgo gave them the following sentence stems to develop their argumentative writing skills:

Theodore Roosevelt has many admirers because ***he established national parks and expanded national forests*****. **

Mr. Hidalgo then made the activity more challenging by introducing stems that required students to consider both pro and con considerations, such as this one:

Although Theodore Roosevelt moved the United States toward becoming a world power, ***critics argue that Roosevelt had imperialistic***

***tendencies, particularly in his approach to foreign affairs*****. **

He also had students complete stems in a way that took a position to help them distinguish between pro/con writing and argumentative writing, and to prepare them for the latter:

While critics of Theodore Roosevelt point to his use of military interventions and limited action on civil rights, ***his accomplishments in***

***conservation, foreign affairs, and support of workers' rights are outstanding legacies*****. **

Mr. Hidalgo had students supply transition words to link sentences about Roosevelt's administration. But because his Level 2 students were more experienced writers, he had them come up with their own transition words rather than giving them a word bank to choose from: Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. ***Consequently, *** he was criticized for interfering in the internal affairs of another country. 

Alternatively, Mr. Hidalgo could have given students the transition and had them complete the sentence:

Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. Consequently, ***he was criticized for interfering in the internal***

***affairs of another country***. 

**Opinion Writing**

Opinion writing is the least demanding type of writing in this genre because students can present one point of view without bringing in arguments on the other side. For Level 1 writers, an opinion piece can consist of just one paragraph. However, they must do more than simply state their opinions. 

They need to back up their opinions with reasons, although their reasons can be based on personal experience rather than evidence. 

For example, a student might write an opinion piece arguing that dogs make better pets than cats. She might talk about how loyal, affectionate, and obedient her own dog is. She wouldn't need to bring in and evaluate arguments against dogs (they need to be walked) or in favor of cats (they keep themselves clean). 

**Fact versus Opinion: Introducing the Distinction**

It's important for students to develop an understanding of the difference between opinion and fact because opinions won't be enough to support their arguments later on when they're writing pro/con or argumentative essays. They'll need evidence. 

You can start introducing students to the fact/opinion distinction in the early elementary grades. In one of our partner schools, for example, a first-grade teacher had her class collectively plan an opinion paragraph explaining why a lot of children love summer. As they came up with a topic sentence and details for the body, the teacher listed the latter in note form on a whiteboard. Then she guided them through the process of coming up with a concluding sentence, producing an outline that looked something like this:

T.S. ***A lot of students love summer*****. **





1. ***no school or homework***

2. ***swimming***

3. ***more time outside***

4. ***longer days***



C.S. ***Summer is the best time of the year! ***



During this kind of activity, a teacher can point out that the concluding sentence is an opinion, and the details on the numbered lines are facts that support it. 

Some topics don't lend themselves to reasons beyond the author's personal experience. If you ask your students to write an opinion piece about what the best holiday is, they're probably going to list the reasons *they* like Christmas or Thanksgiving. To help your students develop the skills that will help them write argumentative essays, you'll need to choose topics that lend themselves to reasoned debate, based on facts. **Your students will** **need to have factual information they can draw on to support their opinions. **

**Pro/Con Writing**

Level 2 students may be able to go straight to pro/con compositions, which are a significant step up from opinion pieces. Each body paragraph in the essay presents one side of an issue and the evidence that supports it. A student might write a pro paragraph explaining that the ambition of Alexander the Great was a positive trait because he brought the benefits of Greek civilization to other lands. Then the student could write a con paragraph that it was a negative trait because Alexander's conquest of foreign lands caused so much suffering. 

A pro/con essay has an introduction and a conclusion, but—unlike in an argumentative essay—students take a neutral stance, simply presenting the claims and evidence on each side. 

**Using Pro or Con SPOs and Paragraphs as Stepping Stones**

Before asking your students to undertake an entire argumentative essay—which would raise two points of view and present evidence for and evaluate each—first give them ample practice planning a single paragraph that summarizes the arguments for a position on one side, backed by evidence. 

Next, they can practice planning another single paragraph that summarizes the opposing view—again, backed by evidence. These activities will prepare them to write a pro/con essay that neutrally presents two points of view. The activities will also equip students for the more challenging task of deciding which position is stronger and why, which they'll confront when they write argumentative essays. 

It's important to include language like “some argue,” and “others say” in a pro/con essay. If the second half of the sentence just says, “it led him to take actions that caused a great deal of suffering,” the author is making an argument rather than neutrally summarizing claims on both sides—and that kind of writing belongs in an argumentative essay, not a pro/con one. 

**Matching Opposing Topic Sentences with Details**

A great way to introduce the skill of constructing arguments on two sides is to provide two SPOs, one pro and one con, that have only the topic sentences filled in. At the top, provide a list of details, in note form, and ask students to match each detail to the appropriate topic sentence. As always, when first introducing students to this activity, model it by guiding the whole class through it orally. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole gave her class the following activity on zoos. One topic sentence took a pro-zoo position and the other an anti-zoo one. Students had to look at the list of details provided and copy them onto the appropriate dotted lines. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

provide food + water + shelter

captivity → animals distressed

care for injured + abandoned animals

educate visitors/conservation

small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)

no socializing w/ others → bored

protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct

visitors tease animals

T.S. Zoos are harmful to animals and should be abolished. 

1. ***small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)***

2. ***captivity → animals distressed***

3. ***no socializing w/ others → bored***

4. ***visitors tease animals***

T.S. Zoos provide benefits to both animals and people. 

1. ***provide food + water + shelter***

2. ***care for injured + abandoned animals***

3. ***protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct***

4. ***educate visitors/conservation***

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo gave his history class the following activity about the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

conservation

not enough progress/civil rts

over-regulated business

treatment of Nat. Amer. 

PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression

constructed Panama Canal

supported workers

consumer rts. 



T.S. Theodore Roosevelt's presidency was flawed. 

1. ***PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression***

2. ***not enough progress/civil rts*****. **

3. ***over-regulated business***

4. ***treatment of Nat. Amer*****. **



T.S. Theodore Roosevelt left a great legacy. 

1. ***conservation***

2. ***supported workers***

3. ***constructed Panama***** Canal**

4. ***consumer rts***

By providing details, you're essentially doing the research for your students so they can focus on deciding which evidence supports which claim. 

When embedded in the content of the curriculum, this activity will also encourage your students to engage in close reading of texts. They'll need to think carefully to decide which details from the text go with which topic sentence. 

Tell your students they should list the strongest reason or evidence last, where it will have the most impact on the reader. That means they'll need to decide which detail provides the strongest argument in support of each claim. This practice evaluating the strength of claims will also prepare students for deciding which position they want to take when it's time to write argumentative essays. 

**Creating Pro/Con SPOs from Scratch**

Once students have become familiar with matching details to the appropriate topic sentence and evaluating their strength, they can start creating their own SPOs. Tell them to write a topic sentence and a concluding sentence for each paragraph—pro and con—and write supporting details in note form on the dotted lines of each outline. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole decided her class was now ready to build on their previous activities by creating their own SPOs on the subject of zoos—one summarizing the pro arguments and the other summarizing the opposing view. To do this, they would need to create topic and concluding sentences. 

Since her students were second graders, they hadn't yet been introduced to all three strategies for creating effective topic and concluding sentences—

using one of the sentence types, using an appositive, and using a subordinating conjunction. Ms. Cole had taught them only the first strategy, using one of the four sentence types: a command, a question, an exclamation, or a statement. She reminded them of each type before they began filling out their SPOs. 

The following are examples of the SPOs students produced:

T.S. ***Zoos benefit animals in many ways*****. **





1. ***provide food + water + shelter***

2. ***care for injured + abandoned animals***

3. ***protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct***

4. ***educate visitors/conservation***



C.S. ***Zoos keep animals safe and help them survive*****. **



T.S. ***It is cruel to keep animals in zoos*****. **





1. ***small exhibits/little place to roam (e.g., elephants)***

2. ***captivity → animals distressed***

3. ***could never survive in the wild***

4. ***visitors tease animals***



C.S. ***Boycott zoos! ***



**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo also had his history students plan their own pro/con SPOs on Theodore Roosevelt. He required his students to come up with different topic sentences than the ones he had supplied for the matching activity, and he reminded them of the three strategies to create one. 

Similarly, he required students to come up with some different details than the ones he had provided. He reminded them to include the sources for the details in note form so that they would be able to provide citations or incorporate quotations from the text if and when they turned their SPOs into paragraphs. 

T.S. ***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency had shortcomings*****. **





1. ***used force to achieve foreign policy***

2. ***over-regulated business***

3. ***not enough progress/civil rts***

4. ***treatment of Nat. Americans***



C.S. ***Although Theodore Roosevelt accomplished a great deal, his presidency was flawed*****. **

T.S. ***Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, had a positive impact on the United States*****. **



1. ***nat'l parks + exp. forests***

2. ***labor unions***

3. ***constructed Panama Canal***

4. ***consumer rts/Food and Drug Administration***



C.S. ***In conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt left an impressive record of accomplishments*****. **

**TOs and MPOs for Pro/Con Compositions**

The next phase in developing the skills necessary for the argumentative essay is to have students create a TO or MPO that considers both sides but doesn't take a position. To do that, they can build on their existing pro and con SPOs or use a new topic. 

As we discussed in Chapter 9, the first steps in creating TOs and MPOs are for you to select a topic and lead the students in developing a thesis

statement. If students are choosing a new topic at this point, make sure that it's both debatable and manageable—neither too broad nor too narrow. 

Ask yourself if students will be able to handle the amount of evidence or research required. 

A TO or MPO for a pro/con essay might look something like the ones in Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2:

**Transition Outline (TO)**

**NAME:**____________________________

**DATE:**_________________

**Exhibit 10.2**

As always, the TO and the MPO will differ in what they require of students. In a pro/con TO, students will write thesis and concluding statements that consist of one sentence acknowledging that there are arguments on both sides. A thesis statement might be:

***There are arguments for and against increasing the minimum wage*****. **

Alternatively, students can construct a thesis or concluding statement for a pro/con essay that makes use of a subordinating conjunction:

***Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on many small businesses, others***

***claim that an increased wage would be beneficial to many households*****. **

Remember that if students leave out a phrase like “others claim that,” they're constructing a thesis statement for an *argumentative* essay, not a pro/con essay. A thesis statement for an argumentative essay would read like this:

***Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, an increased***

***wage would be beneficial to many households*****. **

This thesis statement signals that the author has considered the evidence on both sides, has come to a conclusion about which side makes more sense, and is prepared to defend that conclusion with evidence. You can introduce your students to the distinction between pro/con and argumentative thesis statements at this point, but if they haven't had sufficient practice with pro/con essays, they may not be ready to move on to argumentative writing. 

If students are developing an MPO rather than a TO, they'll need to construct a thesis statement but not a concluding statement. When they write their draft, they'll create general and specific statements for their introductory and concluding paragraphs, along with a reworded thesis statement to use in the latter. 

**The Argumentative Essay**

An argumentative essay has to be both persuasive and fair. Students will need to convince the reader that their own position is the stronger one but, at the same time, present the opposing point of view accurately. Their experience writing neutral pro/con essays will help them with the latter task. 

Composing argumentative essays will enhance skills that your students will generally find useful in later life, in the workplace, and personally. 

**Of all the writing genres, argumentative writing will be the most effective at sharpening students' analytical faculties. Learning** **to construct and defend an argument will enable them to think logically and critically. **

**Using an MPO to Plan an Argumentative Essay**

Before your students can start creating an MPO for an argumentative essay, they have to decide which position they're taking. To do that, they'll need to understand the facts and evidence on both sides. Be sure that the class has spent ample time studying and discussing the topic first. 

Students need to know that when creating a thesis statement for an argumentative essay, they should put the argument they're making last. For example, if a student wants to argue that the Industrial Revolution was essentially a positive development, they would *not* write: Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, its drawbacks cannot be ignored. 

Instead, they would end the sentence with the point that the Industrial Revolution brought benefits, as in this sentence: Although the Industrial Revolution had its drawbacks, the many benefits it brought cannot be ignored. 

In addition to the introductory and concluding paragraphs—which will use the GST and TSG structures—the essay will have three or more body paragraphs (see Exhibit 10.3). 

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction GST

**2nd paragraph. ** Lays out the background of the issue accurately, but presents evidence in a way that tends to support the author's position. 

**3rd paragraph. ** Presents the counterclaim and the evidence to support it. 

**4th paragraph. ** Provides the strongest evidence for the author's point of view. 

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion TSG

**Exhibit 10.3**

The standard argumentative essay often consists of five or more paragraphs, although this is not always a requirement. However, when your students begin to write these essays, you may decide to limit them to four paragraphs. They will omit the paragraph right after the introduction that lays out the problem and introduces their own argument. Instead they'll have only two body paragraphs: the first presenting the counterclaim and evidence and the second presenting their own claim and evidence. 

**Students should not attempt to raise a claim and rebut it in the same paragraph. ** In our experience, that approach often leads to a fragmented and confusing presentation of the information. 

**Incorporating Evidence and Quotations**

Since students are unlikely to be experts in the topics they're writing about, they'll need to introduce citations, paraphrases, and quotations. Although they should cite authorities supporting both sides, they'll need to show why those who support their own side are more convincing. 

At the MPO stage, your students won't actually be incorporating complete citations and quotations, but they will be making notations on their outlines referring to them. Later, they'll integrate that evidence as footnotes and references when they convert their MPOs into drafts and final copies. To prepare your students for that task, have them practice introducing quotations and other evidence in a way that supports a claim (see

Chapter 9). 

Certain words are particularly well suited to framing quotations or paraphrases in argumentative writing. When introducing a quotation or summary that supports their claim, students should characterize the source in a way that indicates its authority and uses stronger verbs than *says* or even *believes* to introduce the statement. More powerful verbs include *endorses*, *asserts*, *emphasizes*, *reminds us*, and *affirms*. 

For example, a student seeking authority in arguing against harsh forms of juvenile justice could simply write the following: Professor Clarke said, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

Think how much more mileage the student could get out of that quotation by framing it with an appositive that indicates the speaker's authority and using a verb that links the speaker's ideas to the student's own point of views, such as:

Professor Clarke, a nationally recognized expert on juvenile justice reform, endorses this view when she writes, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

Illustration transitions are also effective ways to introduce textual evidence and quotations, as shown here:

Experts in the field of juvenile justice reform agree that harsh measures don't work. **For example, ** Professor Clarke has written that boot camps

“have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo felt that his students were now ready not only to summarize the arguments on both sides of the debate, but also to take a position and evaluate claims on the other side. He asked his students to think carefully about the arguments on each side and then choose the position they

personally felt was stronger. Their next task was to craft a thesis statement that stated their position and acknowledged a counterclaim. 

He also wanted his students to start citing sources for their evidence and quotations, so he told them to be sure to note them on the details lines of

their MPOs. Exhibit 10.4 shows the MPO that one of his students produced.

**Exhibit 10.4**

**Differentiating Argumentative Assignments**

Level 1 students are not yet experienced enough to plan and write argumentative essays. Therefore, they should keep practicing opinion and pro/con pieces until they've developed the skills necessary for tasks like writing general, specific, and thesis statements; engaging in research; and distinguishing between stronger and weaker arguments. 

However, you may be teaching a class where some Level 2 students are ready to plan argumentative essays using the MPO and others should instead use the TO. Those using the TO will not need to create general and specific statements, and they may not dive as deeply into the evidence, but they will be acquiring skills that will enable them to write more fully fleshed-out argumentative essays in the future. 

**Argumentative Terms**

As students move to more sophisticated expository and argumentative writing, consider giving them lists of words that are geared to those types of writing. For

example, topic sentences using words such as *although* or *while* work particularly well for both pro/con and argumentative writing. 

This would be a good point to introduce your students to words that will come in handy in presenting arguments that are made by others. For example, they can describe those on one side as *proponents* and those on the other as *naysayers*. Instead of simply using the verb *said*, they can use verbs such as *argue* and *maintain*. 

**EXAMPLES:**

Defenders of Theodore Roosevelt argue…. 

Critics of Theodore Roosevelt assert…. 

Exhibit 10.5 provides a list of terms to help students craft their pro/con and argumentative TO and MPO thesis statements.

**Review: Argumentative Writing Activities**

If you're a middle or high school teacher, the following scaffolds will help you guide your students through the activities that lead to the crafting of an argumentative essay. These activities will enable students to organize their material more effectively, think more analytically, and write more coherently as they prepare to tackle argumentative assignments. 

If you're an elementary teacher, your students are probably not yet ready to create argumentative essays. However, if you use the activities leading up to pro/con essays, you'll be laying the foundation for their ability to write argumentative essays at higher grade levels. 

**SENTENCE‐LEVEL STRATEGIES**

Use *because-but-so* activities to present students with a sentence stem that takes a position and have them: Connect a claim to evidence ( *because*), introduce a counterclaim ( *but*), and describe cause/effect relationships ( *so*). 

Use subordinating conjunctions ( *while*, *although*, and *even though*) to write sentences that acknowledge a counterclaim and state a claim. 

Use sentence-expansion activities to present students with a kernel sentence that takes a position. 

Use transition activities to present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims. 

**SINGLE‐PARAGRAPH OUTLINE**

Practice writing topic sentences for paragraphs that summarize a position on one side of an issue, using the three strategies for creating them: Sentence type (a statement expressing the position of advocates)

Subordinating conjunction

Appositive

Match topic sentences taking opposing positions with appropriate details. 

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes a position, backed by evidence. 

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes an opposing view, also backed by evidence. 

**TO AND MPO: PRO/CON**

Practice writing a pro/con thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument without taking a position for a TO (e.g., “Although there are many who argue that an extended school year will benefit students, opponents believe that additional time will not produce meaningful results”). 

Write a complete pro/con TO or MPO that presents the evidence for two sides of an argument without taking a position. 

**MPO: ARGUMENT (FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL 2 STUDENTS)**

*Some students in a class might be ready for the argumentative essay but not yet ready for the MPO, in which case they should use the TO*. 

Practice writing an argumentative thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument and takes a position, placing the author's position at the end of the thesis statement (e.g., “Although extending the school year has many drawbacks, its benefits outweigh them”). 

Develop a four- or five-paragraph MPO that lays out two sides of an argument and takes a position. 

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction: Write only “GST” in the Details box. The thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence on the solid line above the outline. 

**2nd paragraph. ** Lay out the background of the issue accurately, but in a way that tends to support the author's position. (When students are first being introduced to the argumentative MPO, they may omit this paragraph.)

**3rd paragraph. ** Present the counterclaim and the evidence to support it. 

**4th paragraph. ** Provide the strongest evidence for the author's point of view. 

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion: Write only “TSG.” 

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

Generate general and specific statements. 

Practice using transition words and phrases to present and evaluate reasons and claims:

Time and sequence: List reasons and claims on each side. 

Illustration: Provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence. 

Emphasis: Highlight important claims or underscore an argument. 

Change of direction: Introduce or acknowledge opposing claims. 

Conclusion: Signal wrapping up an argument. 

Practice activities that introduce and explain a quotation in a way that supports a claim. 

**To Sum Up**

To be able to plan and write an effective argumentative essay, your students will need to be able to do the following: Understand the difference between fact and opinion. 

Use nouns and verbs that are well suited to argumentative writing (see Exhibit 10.5). 

Integrate quotations with appropriate introductions and explanations. 

Use the SPO to plan two separate paragraphs presenting opposing points of view and evidence to support them. 

Use the TO to plan pro/con essays that present two points of view and supporting evidence in a neutral manner. 

Use the MPO (or TO) to plan four- or five-paragraph argumentative essays that take a position backed by evidence. 

Determine which piece(s) of evidence is (are) the strongest and therefore should be mentioned last.

## CHAPTER 11

**A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students' Writing**



Mya was a third grader at a school with a high-poverty population. Over 75% of students came from socioeconomically disadvantaged families, and Mya was one of them. 

At the beginning of the year, Mya's teacher, Mr. Corwin, gave his students a prompt to gauge their writing skills. Exhibit 11.1 shows what Mya

wrote. 

**Exhibit 11.1**

The paragraph had no particular structure. In fact, it was just one long run-on sentence. It sounded just like Mya did when she spoke in class. 

Mya's school was partnering with The Writing Revolution organization, and Mr. Corwin got training in the Hochman Method from the organization's faculty. Over the course of the year, he was able to teach his students how to construct sentences and outline paragraphs. 

At the end of the year, Mr. Corwin gave Mya and her classmates another prompt, to see how their writing skills had progressed. Mya's SPO

and paragraph are shown in Exhibits 11.2 and 11.3. 





**Exhibit 11.2**

**Exhibit 11.3**

Mr. Corwin realized that Mya still had a few things to learn about writing. But when he looked back at her beginning-of-the-year writing sample, he was struck by the differences he saw. Her paragraph now had a clear structure, with a topic and concluding sentence and supporting details. Her sentences were complete and didn't run on indefinitely. She was able to use transitions to connect her thoughts. And she had learned how to use subordinating conjunctions. 

Mya's response to a writing prompt at the beginning of the year had provided her teacher with guidance on what skills she already had and what she needed to learn. And her end-of-year response revealed—to her and to Mr. Corwin—how far she had come in just one school year. 

**Don't Guess—Assess! **

**WHY ASSESS YOUR STUDENTS' WRITING? **

Enables you to pinpoint skills individual students have or need to acquire

Provides information about the skills you need to focus on for your class as a whole

Helps you set goals for individual students and your class

Tracks the progress your students make over the course of the year

**Using Writing to Monitor Learning**

The strategies and activities you have read about in this book teach students writing skills and guide them to acquire knowledge on a daily basis. As you have probably noticed, they also have great value in revealing how much students are learning, not only about writing skills, but also about the material they are studying. In other words, these activities serve as **formative assessments**. They will help you to monitor your students' 

comprehension of material that has been taught, determine your next instructional steps, and enable you to provide explicit, effective feedback that will move students forward. 

In many schools, particularly at the elementary level, students' progress in literacy is measured by periodic “benchmark” assessments designed to evaluate general comprehension skills like “finding the main idea” of a text. Studies have found that such tests are highly unreliable. In one study, about a thousand children took four different standardized measures of comprehension. Researchers found that the odds of any two tests identifying the same student as a poor reader or a high-achieving one were less than half.1

And because the reading passages on the tests are unrelated to topics in the curriculum, the tests also don't even attempt to assess what students have learned about any content they may have been taught. Writing activities like those described in this book can be a far more reliable and accurate measure of learning—for students, their parents, and their teachers. 

Formative assessments have other advantages as well. When students get prompt and regular feedback, they have a clearer sense of what they've accomplished and what they still need to work on. 

In addition, research has shown that when formative assessment is done frequently, it's one of the most effective ways to enable students to transfer information to long-term memory—a key step in learning. 2

Here is an example of formative assessment if your class has read *Night*.3

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

The prisoners are forced on a death march because ***they have to evacuate the concentration camp. ***

The prisoners are forced on a death march, but ***Eliezer manages to survive. ***

The prisoners are forced on a death march, so ***most die from fatigue, disease, and the bitter cold weather. ***

**Summative assessments**, which occur at the end of a unit of study, measure what learning students have gained over a period of time—at least in theory. When standardized state reading tests are used as summative assessments, they rarely serve that purpose. They usually do not measure the writing skills you have taught, and, as with standardized benchmark assessments, the content of the passages is unlikely to align to the content of the curriculum you're using. In any event, the results are generally not available until months after the tests have been administered. It makes far more sense to use summative assessments, including those that require written responses, grounded in content that has actually been taught. 

**Periodic Assessments to Monitor Writing Progress**

In addition to using TWR activities to monitor your students' progress in learning content you have taught, you should also give periodic assessments specifically aimed at measuring their progress in acquiring writing skills. 

For these kinds of assessments, provide prompts on generic topics that give you a sense of where your students are in relation to each other, what their general strengths and weaknesses are, and what your goals for writing instruction should be. 

At the beginning, middle, and end of the school year, it's important to assess:

What skills have been transferred to independent writing

What skills your students need to acquire

You should give your students a simple prompt without providing guidance or assistance. Be sure the topic is one that your students know well enough to write about coherently. All your students should have the same prompt so that it will be easier for you to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. 

A prompt can consist of a single word or a brief phrase. Some prompts we have found to be useful are:

Friends (or friendship or how to make/keep friends)

Hopes for the future

Role model

Special gift or possession

Personal goals

Favorite season

Favorite pastime

Why do we study the past? *

* For older students. 

One of the skills you are evaluating is a student's ability to write a topic sentence, so avoid prompts that provide a “sentence starter.” If the prompt is

“a great school trip,” for example, many students will start the assignment with those four words. Simple phrases such as “school trip” or “role model” make better prompts. 

Alternatively, you can provide more explanation. For example, rather than simply asking students to write about “a role model,” you could give them the following paragraph:

*A role model is someone you admire for having qualities you would like to have. A role model is a person whose behavior or achievements you* *respect. Think about someone you consider a role model, and write about why that person is special to you. You may choose someone you know* *or someone you have read about. You may choose someone who is alive today or someone who is no longer here but has made a lasting* *impression on you*. 

Another word of caution: try to avoid prompts that are apt to yield lists, such as “winning the lottery” or “my favorite things.” 

Many other subjects could work well as prompts, and you, as the teacher, are the best judge of what your particular students are likely to be able to write about. 

You may not want to use the same prompt for all three writing assessments at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. However, it can provide a clearer basis for comparison if you stay with the same general topic. For example:

**Beginning of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or more interesting parts of [previous grade level]. Describe at least two. 

**Middle of the year:**

Write a paragraph about which subject is your favorite and why. Give two or three reasons. 

**End of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or most interesting parts of [ending grade level]. Describe at least two. 

**How to Administer Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

When you are administering the assessment, the first step is to **explain the purpose of the activity**. Let your students know that the assessment will help you understand where they need help to further develop their writing skills. Remind them to do their best work so you'll be able to see what they already know how to do and what they still need help with. 

To get an accurate picture of what students can do independently, try not to give them any help during the assessment. If a student has difficulty spelling a word, for example, ask him to make his best guess and provide the correct spelling only if he's unable to continue. If a student just can't get started, you might have to provide her with a general suggestion or a topic sentence. **If you do need to provide students with help, be sure to** **note on the assessment exactly what was done with teacher support. **

Your **instructions must be explicit**. First, make it clear that students should keep their writing samples brief. If you're teaching first graders, you may want to tell them that it's fine to write just a sentence or two. Even with older Level 1 and some Level 2 students, it's best to limit the samples to a single paragraph. You'll be asking them to revise and edit their work later, and that may feel overwhelming if they've written at length. 

**If students have learned how to develop an SPO, be sure to remind them to complete one before writing so that you can assess** **their outlining skills. ** If Level 2 students have been taught to develop Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (TOs and MPOs), you might allow them to write up to three paragraphs—after completing an outline, of course. Be sure that students' outlines are attached to their writing samples. 

Typically, these assessments will take no more than one class period to complete, but some students may take less time. **Return the assessment** **samples to students in the next day or two and ask them to revise and edit their work. ** Tell them that the best writers often find ways to improve and correct their work and that it's important for you to see what they would like to change in their writing. 

**It's not necessary to have students make final copies of the assessment, unless the revised and edited version is illegible. **

When the allotted time for revision and editing is up, collect the students' samples and date them. After assessing a student's work, put it in a dedicated folder so you can monitor individual progress. 

**How to Evaluate Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

As we noted in Chapter 6, the following four criteria are generally used to assess writing quality. 

**STRUCTURE**

Are the sentences in the paragraph, or the paragraphs in a longer composition, arranged appropriately? 

**COHERENCE**

Are the sentences (and paragraphs) logically related to one another? 

**UNITY**

Does every sentence support the main idea of the paragraph? 

Does every paragraph support the main idea of the composition? 

**WELL‐CONSTRUCTED SENTENCES**

Are the sentences grammatically correct and clear? 

Are there compound and complex sentences in addition to simple, active ones? 

Do the sentences begin in a variety of ways? 

Judging the quality of student writing may be one of the most difficult tasks in all of educational assessment. Some aspects of writing are easy to quantify—total number of words or sentences, sentence length, spelling, or proper grammar and usage—but others are highly subjective. 

Even experts have disagreed on the best way to go about measuring writing quality. “Over the years,” one team of experts has written, “writing assessment research and practice has suffered from dissension at every point, on almost every feature of stimulating, producing, evaluating, and teaching writing.” 4



Several factors can interfere with the accuracy of writing assessments:

**Decoding. ** When students are asked to write in response to a written prompt, some may have difficulty decoding it. 

**Background information. ** Lack of knowledge about the topic causes some students to have trouble understanding the prompt and/or producing a response. 

**Computers. ** If students write their responses on computers, those who are comfortable using computers will have an advantage over those who aren't. 

**Mechanical errors. ** There are questions about how much weight to give to errors in capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and grammar. 

Although students need to master these aspects of writing, technical mistakes can be distracting and lead teachers to overlook the progress students may have made in organizing their ideas or using complex sentence structures. 

**Handwriting. ** Poor handwriting often has a negative influence on the evaluator. We'll address the subject of handwriting in more detail later in this chapter. 

**RESOURCE**

Writing Assessment Checklists *Appendix F*

The **Writing Assessment Checklists** (Appendix F) can't entirely eliminate the difficulties involved in evaluating writing, but they can provide

guidelines for more accurate judgments, grounded in strategies you have taught. They will tell you where each student stands and can be filled out fairly quickly. 

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Although there's been disagreement among experts about the best way to evaluate students' writing, one meta-analysis of 136 studies of

writing assessment came up with some recommendations.5 They make the most sense when applied to students above third grade, when

most have already acquired the basic mechanics of writing. 

Use assessments to provide students with feedback about the effectiveness of their writing. 

Teach students how to evaluate the effectiveness of their own writing. 

Monitor students' progress in writing on an ongoing basis. 

The report also listed six best practices in writing assessment:

**Allow students to use either paper or computers to write—or have them use the medium you know they're used to. **

Studies have shown that students who use computers score better than those who write by hand—unless they have little experience using a computer to write, in which case they score worse. 

**Try not to judge a writing sample on the basis of the student's handwriting. **

**Mask the students' identities when scoring papers**. Teachers may subconsciously give a student a higher or lower score depending on the quality of her previous work or her race, gender, or ethnicity. One easy way to guard against implicit bias is to have students put their names on the back of a paper rather than the front. 

**Put students' papers in random order before scoring them**. Some studies have suggested that raters' scores will vary depending on the quality of the essays they've just read. If a rater has just read a series of high-quality essays, she's more likely to give the next piece of writing she reads a lower score—and vice versa. 

**Collect multiple samples of each student's work. ** The quality of a student's writing often varies with the type of composition. 

Some are better at writing narratives, and others may excel at argumentative or informational essays. 

**Try to ensure the reliability of your scoring. ** Much of what goes into scoring a piece of writing is subjective. To control for that, schools can offer training for teachers on how to assess writing. Administrators can provide benchmark descriptions or examples for each point on a scale, have multiple teachers score each paper, and base scores on more than one writing task. 

**Comparative Judgment: Another Way of Assessing Writing Quality**

An interesting approach to evaluating writing offers hope that the task will become easier. This method, offered through a British organization called No More Marking, is both more efficient and more reliable than standard methods. The method, called *comparative judgment*, involves having readers compare two pieces of student writing and decide which one is better. Studies have shown that when many such gut-level comparisons are

aggregated, the judgments are highly consistent.6

At TWR partner schools, teachers may use comparative judgment to assess writing progress. Usually the judging is done within a single grade level by teachers of that grade. Student names are not visible, and judging can be done anonymously. 

After judging the writing samples, teachers discuss trends they are noticing across the grade, which informs their next steps for instruction. For example, if teachers notice that many students are not beginning their paragraphs with topic sentences, they can practice using the SPO and the scaffolding activities as a whole class to reinforce this skill. 

Since assessment using comparative judgment takes far less time than other methods of evaluating student writing, teachers have the opportunity to see the writing of a broader range of students than is typical with other rating methods, enabling them to gain perspective that is both deeper and wider on strengths and areas that need improvement. 

No More Marking provides lots of valuable data about how students are doing. Once teachers have that data, the Hochman Method provides the specific strategies that teachers can use to address the weaknesses in student writing that it identifies. 

**Having Students Write in Response to What They've Read**

Many teachers have their students write in response to a specific passage rather than the general prompts we have recommended. There are some benefits, but also potential pitfalls to this approach. 

**The Pros and the Cons**

Having students write about a passage they're given simulates more closely the kind of writing students will be asked to do on state assessments toward the end of the school year. Generally, state literacy tests give students a passage to read and ask them to write in response to it, citing evidence from the text. The tests may also ask students to read two different texts and compare them. 

It's important to understand that using texts as a basis for writing assessments brings its own potential problems. Students may have trouble decoding the texts, or they may lack the background knowledge that would enable them to understand them—especially if the texts don't relate to content covered in the curriculum. If that's the case, the assessment will not be accurately measuring your students' writing skills. 

**Handwriting Matters**

One significant problem as students draft and revise their paragraphs and compositions or take tests is the poor quality of their handwriting. 

Although research hasn't established that using cursive confers cognitive benefits, it's clear there are other reasons to teach students how to use it. 

Good handwriting—including well-formed cursive—can influence a reader's evaluation of the quality of a piece of writing. In addition, students who have never learned or don't use cursive are often unable to read documents, letters, and notes written in cursive. This can prove to be a disadvantage in reading certain text and in communicating with others. 7

Studies do indicate that it's important for children to have handwriting instruction of some kind as opposed to only learning to touch type on a computer. When students engage in the physical activity of carefully shaping letters, it increases their ability to recognize letters, promotes their

recall of words, and improves their spelling accuracy.8

Many schools no longer focus on handwriting instruction, whether cursive or printing. That has led to random acts of capitalization as well as to the failure on the part of many students to leave enough space between words. 

**Maintaining Student Portfolios**

It's a good idea to keep a folder or portfolio of samples of each student's work and assessments throughout the year. This collection of a student's writing can provide a dramatic reminder of the progress a student has made—progress that otherwise might be overlooked. It also provides valuable information for the teacher who has the student the following year. 

**To Sum Up**

When assessing student writing, be aware of the factors that can interfere with an accurate picture—such as a student's difficulty decoding or understanding the text used as a prompt and the frequency of mechanical errors. 

Administer writing assessments in response to a prompt or a text three times a year to measure students' independent writing ability. 

Assess students' ability to develop outlines. 

Assess students' ability to revise and edit their work by allowing them to do so a day or two after the assessment is administered. 

Use the Writing Assessment Checklists to record individual students' progress and that of the class as a whole. 

Use data from assessments to help set your objectives for the class as a whole and differentiate instruction to meet students' individual needs. 

Maintain a folder or portfolio of each student's work to track progress made over the year.
