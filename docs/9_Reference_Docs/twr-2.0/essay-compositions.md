# CHAPTER 9

**Moving On to Compositions: The Transition Outline and the Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

As spring rolled around, Ms. Hamilton knew her fifth graders would soon be expected to produce extended written responses to prompts on their end-of-year state reading tests. They would be asked to read a passage on a topic they might or might not be familiar with and to write at length in response to a prompt about that passage.

In an effort to prepare them for the test, Ms. Hamilton had them read an article about the threat of extinction for the honeybee and write about the causes and effects of extinction. The results weren't encouraging.

Ava wrote one long paragraph that basically repeated the same nugget of information—more or less verbatim from the text—over and over.

Michael's response included a lot of information about the extinction of dinosaurs but had little to do with honeybees. Brandon related a number of details from the article but listed them in no particular order. And Trina—along with a number of other students—just put her head down on her desk, apparently too overwhelmed by the assignment to even try to come up with a response.

Ms. Hamilton wasn't sure what to do. Was the test expecting too much of fifth graders—or at least of the fifth graders in her classroom? Or was there something missing from her teaching? Whatever the problem, in a few short weeks her kids would be expected to produce extended, coherent written responses to a prompt on a test. And she was pretty sure most weren't going to be able to do it.

If writing is hard, then writing at length only makes it harder. One reason it's important to start writing instruction at the sentence level is that it lessens the heavy load that writing imposes on working memory, freeing up cognitive capacity. But even if students have learned how to construct good sentences, writing at length can still result in an overwhelming cognitive load. Writers may need to juggle many complex items in working memory—for example, keeping track of what they've already said or what they're planning to say next. That's why linear outlines are so important: they can "offload" some of that cognitive burden.

As students reach higher grade levels, they're expected not only to write at length but also to write well about topics beyond their personal experience, which requires them to juggle that content in working memory along with the demands of writing. A heavy emphasis on personal narratives in the elementary grades often leaves students unprepared to meet those kinds of writing expectations in middle and high school.

In response to that problem, many states have adopted standards requiring that students write at length and in a variety of genres beginning in the elementary grades—informational and opinion essays as well as narratives. No longer is it enough for a fourth grader to write a paragraph about his summer vacation or a trip to the zoo. The standards may require him to be able to write, for example, compositions that "introduce a topic or text clearly, state an opinion, and create an organizational structure in which related ideas are grouped to support the writer's purpose." 1

While it's important to prepare younger students for the writing demands they'll encounter at higher grade levels, the standards tell us only where students need to end up without explaining how to get them there. Writing standards and assignments based on them are rarely grounded in realistic expectations of children's development, nor do they account for the heavy cognitive load that writing imposes on inexperienced writers of any age.

When asked to write at length in an expository mode, students at all grade levels often struggle with sentence structure, organization, clarity, and coherence. Simply handing out longer and more challenging writing assignments doesn't magically give students the skills they need to create well-crafted compositions.

A **composition** (essay) is a series of paragraphs united by a common theme. The characteristics of effective compositions mirror those of effective paragraphs:

**Structure.** The paragraphs are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader.

**Coherence.** The paragraphs are logically connected with appropriate transition words.

**Unity.** Every paragraph supports the main idea or thesis of the composition.

**Well-constructed sentences.** The sentences within each paragraph are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures should vary (some simple, others compound or complex).

Over the course of many years, my colleagues and I have analyzed countless compositions, research papers, and essays. After looking at both long-term assignments and timed responses to essay questions on tests, we realized that we needed a structured, sequenced method for guiding students to compose longer pieces of writing. A crucial component of that method is to explicitly teach students how to create a linear outline, building on what they've learned about outlining a paragraph.

**The Benefits of Outlining**

**WHY PRACTICE OUTLINING FOR A COMPOSITION?**

Reveals gaps in knowledge or comprehension to both teachers and students

Develops organizational skills

Helps in categorizing information

Provides students with a logical sequence for expository, narrative, and argumentative text structures

Avoids repetition and irrelevant information

Promotes well-structured introductions and conclusions

Develops efficient note-taking skills

Strengthens the ability to create transitions between ideas and paragraphs

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Creating an outline will help your students cement knowledge they've already acquired and gather new information that builds on it. Once students are familiar with outlines and the associated skills, they'll be able to reproduce outlines on scratch paper during tests and use them to write clearer and more coherent responses.

**It's important to remember that, as with the SPO, creating the outline is a powerful activity in itself, regardless of whether a student turns it into a draft or a finished product.** And, as always, it's important to continue sentence-level activities while students are learning to create outlines for compositions.

**The Transition Outline and Multiple-Paragraph Outline**

The Transition Outline (TO), shown in Exhibit 9.1, is designed for students who are ready to write more than one paragraph but not yet ready for the task of writing complete introductions and conclusions.

**RESOURCE**

Transition Outline (TO), _Appendix L_

A composition based on the TO begins with a single sentence, the **thesis statement**, and ends with a single sentence, the **concluding statement**.

Typically, such one-sentence paragraphs are found only in fiction or journalistic writing. Nevertheless, we believe it's important to give students an easier option to introduce and conclude a subject before teaching them how to write more fully developed introductions and conclusions, which we'll describe later in this chapter.

**RESOURCE**

Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO) _Appendix Q_

Some students may be ready to move directly to the more challenging Multiple-Paragraph Outline (MPO), shown in Exhibit 9.2, without first creating TOs.

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**

**Exhibit 9.2**

Students who are familiar with the SPO but not ready for the format of the TO or the MPO can use a Pre-Transition Outline (PTO). The format of the PTO can be found later in this chapter, under "Adapting the TO and MPO: Pre-Transition Outline (PTO)," and in Appendix J.

**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO) _Appendix J_

You will need to use your judgment about what your students are equipped to handle. In classes where there is a significant range of ability, you may decide to provide some students with the TO and others with the MPO, even if all are writing about the same content.

**Prepping for the TO and MPO**

If you've given your students ample practice creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs), they will have already acquired some of the prerequisite skills needed for developing a TO on their own. Specifically, they will have learned how to:

Write supporting details in note form, using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols
Organize and categorize details

They'll also need to acquire two new skills:

Generating a thesis statement that summarizes the theme or main idea of an entire essay
Generating a concluding statement that rephrases the thesis statement

To construct these statements, students will draw on and extend the generalizing abilities they've acquired in summarizing and in composing topic and concluding sentences for the SPO.

Similarly, when it's time to draft and revise a composition using the TO, students who have had experience writing paragraphs will already have acquired some of the skills they need:

Creating topic sentences
Using a variety of sentence structures
Connecting sentences with transition words and phrases

But they will also need to acquire some new skills through repeated practice, including:

Expanding their use of transition words and phrases to connect paragraphs as well as sentences
Learning how to smoothly incorporate quotations from text into their writing

Level 2 students who are ready to move on to drafting and revising compositions using the MPO will also need to acquire another, more challenging skill:

Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs that include not only a thesis statement but also at least two more sentences that provide a larger context for it

When you're introducing students to the TO or the MPO, it's best to base writing assignments on what students have studied previously or are currently learning, as long as they've had time to acquire a good deal of information about the topic. Advanced Level 2 writers can be assigned topics that require research.

We'll begin by explaining how to guide students through the less complex TO process and then discuss how to teach the skills required for the MPO to those Level 2 students who are ready to tackle it. Argumentative compositions, which are particularly challenging, will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.

**Introducing Students to the TO**

Even after students are comfortable creating an SPO and using it to draft a paragraph, they may still need more support before they're ready for the tasks required to write sophisticated essays. It's not necessary to have them start with three paragraphs and then progress to four or five. The length of a composition should be determined by its topic and content.

Be sure to spend a lot of time developing a TO with the whole class following the sequence illustrated in Exhibit 9.3. As with the SPO, outlines don't necessarily have to be converted into drafts.

**Exhibit 9.3**

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING A TO**

1. Select a topic and identify the purpose of the composition.
2. Write the thesis statement.
3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the TO, with the abbreviation T.S. as a reminder to write a topic sentence.
4. Write the details supporting the main idea in the right-hand column for each body paragraph. Use keywords, phrases, abbreviations, and symbols on the dotted lines.
5. Write the concluding statement.

Each step in this sequence is discussed in the following sections.

**1. Selecting a Topic and Identifying the Purpose**

Students must know a topic well before they'll be able to create a TO about it. Book reports, current events related to scientific or geographic issues, and biographies are all good topics.

The teacher, not the student, should select the topic for the TO, and—at least at first—all students should be writing on the same topic. Students will need practice before they can identify a topic on their own that's appropriate for a composition—one that's neither too narrow nor too broad. The Civil War, for example, is too broad, and a discussion of a specific minor battle might be too narrow. A review of the military career of Ulysses S. Grant or an analysis of the Battle of Gettysburg would work better.

Although students at higher grade levels will be writing about more complex topics, they should not be expected to engage in independent research while learning how to construct a TO. That would impose too great a burden on working memory.

After the topic has been chosen, guide students in identifying the purpose and the type of the composition. Will it be an expository, narrative, descriptive, or opinion essay? More advanced writers can combine these structures, but less experienced writers should stick to a single one. For background on these different types of essays, see the discussion in Chapter 5.

**2. Developing a Thesis Statement**

A **thesis statement** is **a statement that conveys the main theme of the entire composition**—just as a topic sentence conveys the main idea of a single paragraph. A thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence at the top of the TO. **The thesis statement and concluding statement are the only complete sentences on the TO.**

Constructing a thesis statement requires that students understand the main points they will be making in a composition and the text structure they will adopt. At the same time, they'll need to be able to state their thesis in a single sentence—and one that is not too detailed.

Tyrell wrote a thesis statement that may remind you of sentences composed by your own students:

**_In this essay, I am going to tell you about the many effects of the Civil War_**.

Tyrell reveals his topic, but it is not obvious exactly what he is going to tell us.

Students may benefit from a thesis statement that explicitly outlines a **plan of development**. This means that the thesis statement presents the main points of the composition in the order in which they will be addressed in the composition. The plan of development provides a clear road map for the rest of the outline.

With guidance, Tyrell rewrote his statement to include a plan of development:

**_The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations_**.

Exhibit 9.4 is a TO showing Tyrell's thesis statement with a plan of development: _economic_, _social_, _political_. Tyrell's thesis statement signals to the reader that the next paragraph of the essay will focus on the economic effects of the Civil War. Then there will be a paragraph on the social effects, and finally a paragraph on the political effects.

**Transition Outline (TO)**

**NAME:** **_Tyrell_**

## **TS**

**CONCLUDING STATEMENT:**

**Exhibit 9.4**

When your students are first learning to create thesis statements, tell them they can draw on the three strategies for creating topic sentences that they've already learned:

**Statement:**
**_The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations_**.

**Subordinating conjunction:**
**_Although the Civil War lasted only four years, its impacts on the economic, social, and political structures of the United States were enormous_**.

**Appositive:**
**_The Civil War, a turning point in the country's history, had major economic, social, and political effects_**.

Students may choose not to include a plan of development, in which case they can experiment with different structures. For example, a thesis statement could simply say:

**_Theodore Roosevelt's presidency marked the beginning of the United tates as a world power_**.

The essay could then address the specifics—the Panama Canal, the Roosevelt Corollary—contained in that general idea.

You may find it helpful to provide students with examples of different approaches they can use when developing their thesis statements: **A personal judgment:**
**_It is urgent that problems associated with rising sea levels as a result of climate change be addressed worldwide_**.

**Advice or directions:**
**_There are several strategies to combat the effect of rising sea levels_**.

**A statement of consequences (cause and effect):**
**_If climate change is not addressed globally, coastal cities will be in danger_**.

**An interpretation (usually of fiction or poetry):**
**_John Knowles's widely read coming-of-age novel, A Separate Peace, presents themes of friendship, envy, and the effect of social class on relationships_**.

**Compare and contrast:**
**_There are significant differences between the candidates regarding their positions on education_**.

Even without a plan of development, students will be able to refer back to their thesis statement to stay on track. Every paragraph in the composition should relate to the theme contained in the thesis statement.

**3. Developing the Main Idea Boxes**

The column on the left side of the TO is headed "Main Idea." The Main Idea boxes are for words or phrases indicating the topic of each paragraph.

Unlike the SPO, the TO does not require students to write out the topic sentences for their paragraphs. However, it can be helpful to have them write the abbreviation T.S. in each Main Idea box to remind them to include topic sentences for each paragraph when they compose their drafts.

Listing the main ideas in the left-hand boxes helps students avoid repetition and ensures that each paragraph relates to the composition's overall theme.

Different types of compositions call for different kinds of main ideas for the body paragraphs, as you can see from the following examples. The order and number of the paragraphs also will depend on the type of assignment.

**BIOGRAPHICAL**

Thesis statement
Early life
Book summary  
Major accomplishment(s)
Opinion
Legacy
Concluding statement

**BOOK REVIEW**

Thesis statement
Book summary
Opinion
Concluding statement

**CAUSE/EFFECT**

Thesis statement
Causes
Effects
Concluding statement

**PROBLEM/SOLUTION**

Thesis statement
Problem
Solution
Concluding statement

**COMPARE AND CONTRAST MAJOR EVENT**

Thesis statement
Similarities
Differences
Impact
Concluding statement

**4. Developing the Details**

The Details boxes are on the right side of the outline. These boxes have dotted lines where students write notes using key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols that will form the basis of their body paragraphs. Students should have sufficient background knowledge to provide at least three details for each paragraph.

**Make sure students understand that they should write the details for each paragraph in note form rather than in full sentences.**

Although students need to settle on the order of the paragraphs when creating the TO, the order of the details may not matter at this point. Students can revise their outlines or change the order of the details when it's time to write their drafts.

**5. Writing the Concluding Statement**

The function of a concluding statement is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. A concluding statement usually does one of the following:

Summarize
Offer a solution or recommendation
Pose a question
Justify a position
Present a point of view

Here are some examples of possible concluding statements, along with thesis statements for the same essays:

**EXAMPLE 1:**

**Thesis statement:**
**_The economic, social, and political effects of the Civil War lasted for generations_**.

**Concluding statement (summary):**
**_In summary, the impact of the Civil War was felt for many years after the fighting ended_**.

**EXAMPLE 2:**

**Thesis statement:**
**_If climate change is not addressed worldwide, coastal cities will be in danger_**.

**Concluding statement (solution or recommendation):**
**_To conclude, nations must work together to prevent rising sea levels from causing widespread destruction_**.

**EXAMPLE 3:**

**Thesis statement:**
**_Theodore Roosevelt's presidency saw the development of the national parks_**.

**Concluding statement:**
**_One of Theodore Roosevelt's most important legacies was his approach to conservation_**.

Students do not need to write concluding sentences for each paragraph in a multiple-paragraph composition.

**Using a Transition Outline to Write an Essay**

Converting a TO into a draft should be an efficient process. Students will know what their topic is, the basics of what they want to say, and the order in which they want to say it. In the drafting and revising process, they can devote their mental energy to crafting clear, interesting, and varied sentences—including topic sentences for their body paragraphs—and using transitions to create a coherent and effective composition.

When students revise their drafts, the benefits of continuing to work on sentence-level activities alongside lengthier writing become clear. Those activities will continue to help students remember to apply strategies like varying their sentence structure and including information their intended audience might need. Students may also need to cite evidence from texts and incorporate quotations.

**Using Transitions to Link Paragraphs**

Transitions enhance coherence and flow in longer pieces of writing. When your students are converting TOs into drafts of compositions and revising them, remind them to use transitions to link one paragraph to the next. Virtually any of the transitions they've learned to connect sentences can also be used to connect paragraphs. See Appendix C, "Transition Words and Phrases."

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases _Appendix C_

For example, if a student is writing a compare-and-contrast composition about red and white blood cells and she has written one paragraph about red blood cells and the next about white blood cells, she can use a change-of-direction transition to create a link between the two paragraphs: _Red blood cells carry respiratory gases throughout the body. These cells lack a nucleus, which means that there is room inside each cell for more of a pigment called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their color and is responsible for carrying oxygen around the body. Red blood cells also transport carbon dioxide_.

**\*On the other hand**, white blood cells fight infection. These cells circulate throughout the bloodstream and tissues to attack unknown organisms that may cause an illness or injury. Unlike red blood cells, white blood cells have a nucleus\*.

**Incorporating Quotations**

When students begin to write longer compositions, they are often encouraged not just to cite evidence from texts but also to quote from them directly. When students are creating outlines, they should be taught how to include the page number(s) and source(s) of the quotation(s) they plan to use. If they are using more than one source, they will need to include the author as well.

Too frequently, students will use a quotation without providing any context, introduction, or attribution. In addition, it's often not clear why students have chosen a particular quotation. They may assume its meaning and relevance are obvious, or they may not have fully understood the words themselves. At times it seems that students are inserting a quotation simply to prove they've read the text rather than to support the point they're making.

If you want your students to use quotations effectively, you have to show them how to be judicious about selecting the text they want to quote and how to incorporate that text smoothly into their own writing. They'll need to answer these questions:

_What does the quotation mean?_
_Whose words are they?_
_How does the quotation support the point I'm making?_

**Understanding the Quotation**

To ensure that students actually understand the words they're quoting, ask them to paraphrase the quotation for you. For example: Quotation: _"Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere."_

Paraphrased quotation: _No matter where suffering happens and who is affected, it has an impact everywhere and on everyone_.

Once they've done that, students should make sure they know the source of the quotation and whether that source or speaker is reliable. Then they can ask themselves if the quotation belongs in the spot where they're intending to use it. If it does, they can include the source of the quotation and page number on an appropriate detail line of their TO.

**Determining What's Noteworthy**

It's helpful to explain to students that a longer quote isn't always a better quote. A succinct phrase may have more impact than a discussion that goes on for several lines.

Nor is it always necessary for students to include a direct quotation. Paraphrasing text often works just as well. However, even if a quotation is paraphrased, students should include an attribution to the text on which it's based.

Quotations should be reserved for instances when the author of the text has said something particularly noteworthy. Consider guiding your students in identifying those distinctive quotations before they attempt to select them independently.

**Weaving In Quotations**

Once they've settled on a quotation that is on point and worthy of inclusion, students will need to learn how to weave it into their own writing.

The book _They Say/I Say_ suggests introducing quotations using phrases like these:

_Jones states, "\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***."_
_As the author of the article argues, "\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***."_
_According to Jones, "\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***."_

The authors also suggest following up the quotation with an explanation that paraphrases it. For example,

_In other words, Jones is saying\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***._
_Therefore, according to the author,\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***._
_Jones's point is that\***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\***._

**Level 1 Example**

_According to Helen Keller, "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart."_

_Her point was that even though she was blind and deaf, she was still able to experience the most meaningful parts of life_.

**Level 2 Example**

More advanced students may be quoting from primary sources or historical documents, and this is when setting up and paraphrasing quotations is particularly important. It won't always be clear to a reader where the quotation is from and—especially if the language is complex or archaic—what it means.

_The Declaration of Independence states, "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security." In other words, revolution is justified only when the government has carried out a sustained and deliberate campaign against the rights of the people_.

**TEACHER TIP**

Emphasize to your students the importance of citations and attribution when they use quotations in their writing. Quotations should be set off by quotation marks or, if lengthy, be indented as a block quote. Older students can be introduced to the various ways to cite sources, such as footnotes, endnotes, and in-text. It's best to demonstrate just one form of documentation, preferably the MLA, APA, or Chicago/Turabian formats.

The example in Exhibit 9.5 assumes students have learned about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

**Exhibit 9.5**

**The MPO for Level 2 Students**

If your Level 2 students have already had practice with the TO, most of the steps involved in creating the MPO will be familiar.

If they haven't had that practice, guide them through these activities, all of which are described in detail in the previous section:

**OUTLINING**
Select a topic and identify the purpose.
Develop a thesis statement.
Fill in the Main Idea boxes.
Fill in the Details boxes.
Write a concluding statement.

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**
Use transitions to link paragraphs.
Incorporate quotations.

A significant difference between the TO and the MPO is that instead of writing a thesis statement as a stand-alone sentence, students will now create a multi-sentence introductory paragraph composed of a thesis statement as well as general and specific statements. The same is true for a concluding paragraph. This process often requires a good deal of guidance and practice.

Constructing an MPO involves six steps. The sequence of the steps corresponds to the numbers that appear on the sample MPO template in Exhibit 9.6. MPOs can have three, four, five, or more paragraphs. As we noted earlier, students don't have to start with three-paragraph MPOs and then progress to longer ones. The number of paragraphs assigned should depend on the topic and the content.

As with the SPO and TO, you should spend a lot of time developing MPOs with the whole class before expecting students to develop an MPO independently.

**THE STEPS FOR DEVELOPING AN MPO**

1. Select a topic and identify the composition's purpose.
2. Develop the thesis statement as a complete sentence on the solid line at the top of the outline. Tell students that this is the only time they'll write a complete sentence on the MPO.
3. Write the main idea of each paragraph as a phrase or category in the Main Idea boxes on the left-hand side of the MPO and include T.S. as a reminder to create a topic sentence later when drafting.
4. Write the supporting details for each main idea in the Details boxes in the right-hand column of the MPO.
5. Indicate the structure of the introductory paragraph by writing the letters _G_ (for _general_ statement), _S_ (for _specific_ statement), and _T_ (for _thesis_ statement). The statements themselves should be created only after the outline is done.
6. For the concluding paragraph, invert the order of the introduction to _T_, _S_, and _G_.

Steps 1–4 have been described previously, but steps 5 and 6 are new and specific to the MPO. The next section will define GST and TSG and describe the process of using them as a guide to develop introductions and conclusions.

**Using the MPO to Draft and Revise Compositions**

Converting an MPO to a draft is more challenging than undertaking that process with a TO because students will need to create general and specific statements during the drafting process. They will need ample practice with the preparatory activities described in this section.

Don't forget that students should use transition words and phrases to connect their paragraphs and smoothly incorporate quotations, as discussed previously in this chapter.

## Introductions: The GST Structure

Introductions set forth the topic of the composition and should engage the reader's interest. Writing introductory and concluding paragraphs requires the ability to summarize information and make generalizations at an even more sophisticated level than that required for writing only the thesis statement.

Both introductory and concluding paragraphs should consist of at least three sentences. In addition to the thesis statement, students will also need to learn how to construct general and specific statements that support their thesis. This process, which is described in _The St. Martin's Handbook_, will result in coherent paragraphs that provide context for the thesis statement.

Some teachers may believe that the GST format makes students' introductions too formulaic. But the fact is that most developing writers actually need and appreciate a formula to help them structure coherent introductions and conclusions. We have seen this technique applied in sophisticated essays written by experienced writers.

According to the handbook, introductory paragraphs should unfold in this order:

1. First sentence: general statement (_G_)
   **_There are books that were written decades ago that are relevant today because of their timely themes_**.

2. Second sentence: specific statement (_S_)
   **_The Great Gatsby has fascinated readers over the years because of its focus on extreme wealth, unbridled materialism, and the decay of social and moral values_**.

3. Third sentence: thesis statement (_T_)
   **_Although the book was published in 1925, the characters, the setting, and the conflicts resonate with present-day readers_**.

Using the GST format can be challenging. Even students who have had experience crafting thesis statements may need support in coming up with general and specific statements. One way to provide that support is to model or guide them through the process.

**GST: Classroom Example**

Using the topic of Nelson Mandela, whom the class had been studying, Ms. Jackson began by asking her tenth graders to come up with a **thesis statement** about him. After some discussion, the class agreed on the following:

**_Nelson Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black president_**.

After completing the Main Idea and Details boxes for the composition with the whole class, Ms. Jackson asked the students what general category of individuals they thought Mandela belonged to. One student said, "freedom fighters"; another said, "civil rights activists"; and a third suggested "people who had a big effect on history." Ms. Jackson chose the third phrasing, and collectively the class wrote:

**_During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history_**.

Ms. Jackson told the class that could be their **general statement**. Now, she said, it was time to narrow the focus to come up with a more **specific statement**, perhaps by placing Mandela in a particular place. The students came up with "South Africa." Ms. Jackson asked them to try writing a specific statement using an appositive. After comparing their different formulations, the class agreed on this one:

**\*Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa**.

The class then put all three sentences together to form an introductory paragraph using the GST format:

**_During the 20th century, certain individuals had a significant impact on history. Nelson Mandela, a leader in the struggle for equal rights for all citizens, brought great change to South Africa. Mandela is remembered for his role in the abolition of apartheid and his election as South Africa's first Black president_**.

Here are two additional examples of introductory paragraphs that follow the GST format. The words in bold indicate elements of the plans of development that are embedded in the thesis statements.

## BOOK REPORT

**[G]** Only a few of the countless books published each year become classics. **[S]** William Golding's novel about a group of British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash has been required reading in many schools for decades. **[T]** _Lord of the Flies_ has intrigued readers because of its **plot, characters,** and **the lessons** that can be learned from this compelling tale.

**SIGNIFICANT EVENT**

**[G]** All of the great presidents have a signature achievement that profoundly affected future generations. **[S]** The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France is considered by many to be Thomas Jefferson's outstanding accomplishment. **[T]** As a result of the Louisiana Purchase, he significantly **increased the size of the United States, extended its borders,** and **opened up new trade routes.**

**Writing General, Specific, and Thesis Statements**

The amount of time you spend teaching your students how to develop general, specific, and thesis statements will vary depending on their abilities and the complexity of the content they're studying.

The following kinds of activities should be modeled and practiced frequently with the entire class before you have students try them independently.

The following activities are listed in the sequence in which they should be introduced.

**1. Write a Thesis Statement (T) When Given a Topic**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a thesis statement (T) for the given topic.

**TOPIC:** Napoleon's impact

T: **_Napoleon's impact on France had both positive and negative aspects_**.

**2. Distinguish among General (G), Specific (S), and Thesis (T) Statements**

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the general statement, specific statement, and thesis statement by writing G, S, or T.

**_S_** In 1936, an athlete impressed spectators at the Berlin Olympics with his skill and talent.

**_T_** Jesse Owens, a formidable Black track and field star, is remembered for shattering world records.

**_G_** Many Olympians have made a significant impact on their sport.

**3. Write an S When Given a G and a T**

If students are having trouble coming up with a specific statement, you can suggest that they try answering one or more of the question words (_who_, _what_, _when_, _where_, _why_, and _how_). Another good option is to include an appositive. The following example assumes students have read the book _Lyddie_.

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a specific statement (S) for the given general statement (G) and thesis statement (T).

G: People often have different ideas of how to define "fairness."

S: **_Diana and Lyddie, two characters in Katherine Paterson's novel Lyddie, have differing points of view_**.

T: Although Diana is radical and tries to entice other factory workers to sign a petition, Lyddie does not agree with Diana's perspective until the very end of the novel.

**4. Write a G and an S When Given a T**

**DIRECTIONS:** Write a general statement (G) and a specific statement (S) for the given thesis statement (T).

G: **_An invasive species is an organism that is not native to a particular area_**.

S: **_In the Florida everglades, the Burmese python has been wreaking havoc on native animal populations since it was first introduced to the area in 1994_**.

T: Although these enormous reptiles continue to pose a problem for this once-thriving ecosystem, scientists in Florida are developing methods to reduce their numbers.

**5. Adding Sentences to the Introductory Paragraph**

As students become more proficient, there is no need to limit their introductions to three sentences. Typically, the fourth or fifth sentences are specific statements, often facts or statistics.

**DIRECTIONS:** Write an additional specific statement (S).

G: As the United States grew in industrial and economic power, two controversial figures emerged.

S: By the end of the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie controlled almost the entire steel industry and John Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company controlled 90% of the refining business.

S: **_Both men made tremendous philanthropic contributions that made them heroic in the views of many_**.

T: However, there have been debates about whether these early builders of big business in America should be considered "robber barons" or "captains of industry."

**Crafting Conclusions**

As with the concluding statement in the TO, the function of the concluding paragraph in the MPO is to restate and reinforce the thesis statement of the composition. It should accomplish at least one of the same goals as the TO concluding statement, such as offering a summary, solution, or recommendation.

The structure of the concluding paragraph reverses the structure of the introductory one: instead of GST, the concluding paragraph follows a TSG pattern. The thesis statement should be rephrased and positioned as the first sentence instead of the last.

Consider these examples of an introduction and conclusion following the GST and TSG formats on the topic of the monarch butterfly.

**INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:**

_The migration of the monarch butterfly has always been fascinating to scientists. However, there are both habitat and environmental factors that pose threats to this favorite flying insect. Even though historically the monarch butterfly population has come back from challenges that have threatened its existence, recovering from the use of pesticides, climate change, and development may be more problematic_.

**CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH:**

_Although monarch butterflies have bounced back from past threats caused by nature, the hazards caused by people may be too monumental for this popular butterfly population to overcome. Concerns about the future of the monarch are valid and serious. It is imperative to address the dangers confronting this remarkable butterfly before it becomes extinct_.

Remind students that the last words in a composition usually have the most impact on the reader; therefore, the concluding paragraph should contain its key points. After the first sentence, which will be the rephrased thesis statement, students should write specific and general statements that differ from the ones they used in their introductory paragraph. Both should expand on the S and G statements that appear there. If students are having trouble rephrasing the three types of statements in their conclusions, you can provide them with some sample introductory paragraphs and have them practice reconstructing them as concluding paragraphs.

**Two Primary Causes of the American Revolution**

_The factors that led to the American Revolution have been described by countless historians. There were multiple events that played a role in the colonists' rebellion, but two are especially important. The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were crucial in the decision to declare war on Great Britain_.

_In 1774, the British wanted to make an example of Massachusetts after the Boston Tea Party. As a result, the Intolerable Acts, a group of four acts, were passed. They denied Massachusetts the right to govern itself. In addition, Boston Harbor was blockaded, and fair trials were prevented. Finally, the last act applied to all the colonies, not just Massachusetts. British troops were ordered to be stationed at more convenient locations and the expenses were to be paid by the colonies_.

_In 1765, the Stamp Act was intended to raise money from the colonists by taxing all printed paper, even playing cards, but it was enacted without the approval of their assemblies. The colonists believed they should have the same rights as the English. Patrick Henry's publication attacking the act, Virginia Resolves, was widely read. The phrase "taxation without representation" became popular_.

_The Intolerable Acts and the Stamp Act were primary reasons for the American Revolution. As a result of the burdens these acts placed on the colonists, their fury grew. Their anger eventually led to a strong desire for independence from Great Britain_.

**Differentiating TO and MPO Activities**

Practice in any of the preceding activities can help students who are having difficulty with particular elements of the TO and MPO. Here are some further suggestions you can use for additional support:

TO: Provide students with the thesis and concluding statement(s).

TO and MPO: Provide students with the thesis statement and words and phrases for the Main Idea column to help them organize their paragraphs.

TO and MPO: Provide students with both a main idea and details for the first body paragraph.

MPO: Provide Level 2 students who are ready for the MPO with a thesis statement and/or the general or specific statements to use in their introduction and conclusion.

**Adapting the TO and MPO: The Pre-Transition Outline**

For students, particularly those in elementary school, who are not ready for the TO or MPO formats, we suggest using a hybrid of an SPO and TO, the Pre-Transition Outline (PTO), to help them begin thinking about the requirements of MPOs and essays. As with the TO, for the PTO students select the topic first and then develop a thesis statement. In contrast to the TO, on the PTO students write out a full topic sentence for each paragraph as they would on an SPO; however, they do not need to add a concluding sentence for each paragraph. Instead, the PTO ends with a concluding statement that paraphrases the thesis statement.

It's best if the PTO is only two or three paragraphs long and has three or four details. The fourth detail is in parentheses to indicate that it is considered optional depending on the topic. See the following example of a completed PTO. (Also see Appendix J.)

**RESOURCE**

Pre-Transition Outline (PTO) _Appendix J_

When students have mastered completing the PTO and developing drafts based on it, move right on to the TO. It's preferable to have students become accustomed to the TO sooner rather than later because, together with the MPO, those formats will be more beneficial to students as they write longer essays about more complex and detailed topics.

CONCLUDING STATEMENT: **_In closing, both Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton left important legacies for women's rights_**.

**Research Papers**

Teaching students effective research skills is challenging but important. If students haven't learned how to research a topic, they may find themselves investing a lot of effort in a project that relies on information that is questionable or just plain wrong.

It's all too easy for students to stumble on a website that looks reliable but is riddled with misinformation. Students may also mistake personal opinions they find online for fact or become overwhelmed by the amount of information available.

Make sure your students are staying on track over the days or weeks that they're working on their projects. Once students have their topics, it's best to set up a detailed schedule listing due dates for each stage of the process: gathering material, developing a thesis, coming up with a bibliography, taking and organizing notes, and so on. We suggest that you require students to get your approval for each section before moving on to the next step.

A full discussion of how to help your students do research online is beyond the scope of this book, but we can offer a few suggestions. We also recommend consulting the article _"The Challenge That's Bigger than Fake News: Civic Reasoning in a Social Media Environment,"_ published in _American Educator_ magazine and authored by a group of researchers at Stanford University.

**Surfing the Internet—with Guardrails**

Model the process of searching online for the class, just as you model TWR strategies and activities. Tell students that when they look for information and evidence on the internet, it's important to be aware of the following guidelines and search suggestions, which are drawn from the aforementioned _American Educator_ article as well as an article in _Education Week_ on teaching online research skills:

Use precise keywords in online searches. Typing _Kennedy assassination_ might return results about the assassinations of both John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy instead of just one of them.

Use certain words and symbols to refine online searches.
Use quotation marks around search terms to get the exact wording.
Insert "AND" between search terms to produce results that focus on both subjects.
Include a space followed by a minus sign to eliminate a particular meaning of a term (for example, a student searching for information about the Australian Outback could type _Outback -car_ to eliminate results relating to the Outback vehicle).

Check whether a website's URL ends in _.com_, _.gov_, or _.edu_. Websites connected with a government agency (_.gov_) or university (_.edu_) are generally more trustworthy than someone's personal website. But warn students that _.org_, previously associated with mission-driven organizations, is no longer a sign of reliability; practically any organization can now obtain that designation.

Evaluate websites with a critical eye. Students should be asking questions such as: Who wrote this? What is his or her perspective? Who is sponsoring this site? Are there links and references to other sources that corroborate the information? Asking these questions while on the site itself may not be enough. It can be more useful to leave the site and see what other sources say about it.

Don't click on the first result that comes up after a Google search. It's best to go down the list and examine URLs and the sentences that accompany each result for clues to reliability.

Use Wikipedia wisely. Although many educators warn students away from the site, it can be useful if you know how to use it. Students should learn to investigate Wikipedia's "Talk" pages, where they'll find debates on controversial issues, and to use the references at the end of each article as resources for lateral reading.

Ms. Hamilton was right: her fifth graders didn't do well on their written responses for the state test. But the following year, she tried a different approach. She taught her students sentence-level strategies as well as how to create the SPO and TO.

In the spring, as in previous years, she wanted to do what she could to prepare her students for the writing prompts they would see on the state test. They would probably still have to deal with unfamiliar content in the reading passages. But, she hoped, at least they would now have writing skills that would help them produce coherent responses.

The day before testing began, she gave them a text to read about space exploration—a topic they hadn't learned about in class. "Based on this article," she wrote on the board, "what are the most significant challenges to exploring outer space?" Then she handed out blank sheets of paper.

Almost all of her students got right to work. But they didn't just start writing. First, they created outlines without a template, identifying the topic and writing a thesis statement below it, using the prompt on the board as a guide.

Most wrote some version of "There are several significant challenges to exploring outer space," but some outlined a plan of development. A boy named Malik, for example, wrote, "The most significant challenges to exploring outer space are radiation, the lack of gravity, and the distance from Earth."

Then students drew boxes for main ideas and details and began filling them in. Once they had their concluding statements at the bottom, they were off and running, converting their outlines into drafts.

Ms. Hamilton felt a wave of relief wash over her. This year, when her students saw a writing prompt on the test, she was pretty sure they wouldn't just flail or freeze. They would know what to do.

**To Sum Up**

Before trying to create TOs, students need ample experience developing topic sentences, writing supporting details in note form, and constructing coherent paragraphs.

Level 1 and less advanced Level 2 students should initially use these skills to create simple three- or four-paragraph TOs for book reports, biographies, and compositions on scientific or geographic topics.

Introduce students to the TO or MPO by modeling the process of creating one.

When students are still learning to create TOs and MPOs, you should assign the topics; for more experienced students, you should provide guidance in selecting a topic.

Provide students with models of thesis statements that fit the type of TO or MPO they're constructing, and, when appropriate, have them include a plan of development that maps out the structure of the composition.

Have students fill in the Main Idea and corresponding Details boxes for each paragraph of the TO and MPO in note form.

To prepare Level 2 students to write introductory paragraphs for the MPO, introduce them to the GST formula—incorporating general, specific, and thesis statements—and have them practice distinguishing among the three types of statements and then creating them.

Have students reverse the formula to TSG for the conclusion.

Have students convert their completed TOs and MPOs to drafts and then revise them by varying sentence structure, incorporating quotations (if any), and using transitions to link paragraphs and sentences.

If Level 2 students' MPOs require independent research, have students commit to a schedule with deadlines for each step of the process.

# CHAPTER 10

**Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays**

Ms. Giannelli was familiar with the state writing standards that applied to her seventh graders. She knew they needed to be able to write arguments in which they supported their claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence, while acknowledging another point of view.

After searching online for argumentative writing prompts, Ms. Giannelli found a wealth of ideas for middle schoolers. She decided to give her class a choice of just three topics:

Should cell phones be allowed at school?

Should students have homework on weekends?

Should exotic animals be kept in captivity?

Ms. Giannelli knew her students had lots of opinions on the first two questions, and she suspected the third one would appeal to the animal lovers in the class. To help them get started on a topic they might not know much about, she provided the two sentences that had accompanied the prompt online: “Many exotic animals live longer in captivity. However, many people argue that it's not a good way of life for them.”

Ms. Giannelli was pleased to see that as students chose their topics, there was a buzz of excitement in the air. After about half an hour, she decided to check their progress.

Some students seemed to have gotten stuck after the first sentence or two—especially those who had chosen to write about animals in captivity. Most were against the idea, but they had trouble coming up with reasons beyond their conviction that the animals would be unhappy.

Students who chose one of the other topics had produced more prose, but it wasn't what Ms. Giannelli had hoped for. Ari's essay was pretty typical. She took a strong stand against homework on weekends. But her reasons were entirely personal. She explained how tired she was after school on Fridays and listed all the activities she would like to engage in during a typical weekend. Ms. Giannelli didn't think these reasons counted as “evidence.” Nor did Ari acknowledge that anyone else might think homework on weekends was a good idea, let alone raise the arguments such a person might make and try to rebut them.

The standards were clear, and it was equally clear Ms. Giannelli's students weren't equipped to meet them. What wasn't clear was what she could do about that.

Teachers frequently assign opinion and argumentative essays to satisfy the requirements of state writing standards. Children as young as third grade are expected to present their claims and convince a reader of their point of view. By sixth grade, they're supposed to be supporting their claims with evidence, and by seventh grade they should be acknowledging arguments on the other side. As we have discovered, even older students often struggle to write these kinds of essays if they haven't learned the appropriate language and structures.

When you have students practice the skills leading up to argumentative writing, choose a topic that has two debatable sides. Whenever possible, the topic should be embedded in the content students are studying. Often opinion or argumentative writing is treated as a separate category that can be addressed only by having students take and defend positions on topics beyond the school curriculum—such as the pros and cons of school uniforms.

However, choosing a topic they've been studying is an ideal way to build and deepen their knowledge of content. Stay alert for topics in the curriculum, at whatever grade level you're teaching, that lend themselves to pro/con writing. For example, students can write about the pros and cons of traveling west in covered wagons, the strengths and weaknesses or flaws in a particular book or character, or arguments for and against using atomic bombs to attack Japan in World War II.

If you've been using TWR's method, your students have already been building the skills they'll need to craft effective arguments: Completing sentence stems using _because_, _but_, and _so_ develops students' ability to connect a **claim** to evidence, introduce a **counterclaim,** and describe cause/effect relationships.

Using subordinating conjunctions such as _while_ and _although_ and transitions such as _however_ and _on the other hand_ to begin sentences enables students to acknowledge or make a claim while simultaneously bringing in an opposing claim.

Sentence expansion using a kernel that takes a position develops students' ability to state a claim.

Transitions present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims.

Creating topic sentences and thesis statements enables students to identify the main points they want to make in an argument.

Summarizing develops students' ability to succinctly describe claims on both sides.

Creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs that are either pro or con), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs) helps students logically organize claims and evidence.

Incorporating quotations and paraphrases during the revision process teaches students how to cite evidence for claims in an effective way.

As we emphasize throughout this book, however, these strategies will help students write well only if they have knowledge of what they're writing about. That applies to argumentative writing as much as to any other genre.

**Preparing for Argumentative Writing**

Often students approach argumentative writing by progressing along three types of paragraphs and compositions:

**Opinion:** Author tries to convince a reader to adopt a certain point of view; opinion writing is the easiest and is generally assigned to elementary students.

**Pro/con:** Author lays out two sides of an issue and presents the evidence to support each side but doesn't take a position.

**Argumentative:** Author presents the evidence for both sides but also decides which position has more merit and defends the one he supports.

Opinion and pro/con writing assignments constitute a scaffold leading to the argumentative essay—the most challenging of these three types of writing. In writing opinion pieces, younger students get practice listing reasons that support a claim. When crafting body paragraphs of a pro/con essay, students learn to state opposing positions and present evidence that supports each one. If they actually agree with one side rather than the other, they get practice suspending their own opinions and putting themselves in the shoes of someone on the other side—a skill that will serve them well when they turn to argumentative writing and need to summarize an opposing viewpoint fairly.

**WHY PRACTICE WRITING OPINION, PRO/CON, AND ARGUMENTATIVE PIECES? **

Develops analytical and logical thinking skills

Helps students distinguish reliable sources from unreliable ones

Improves organizational skills

Teaches students to cite textual evidence effectively

Develops the ability to assess and rank stronger and weaker arguments

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Planning and outlining before writing a draft of any of these essay types deepens and reinforces students' understanding of content. Moreover, as with other outline strategies, these benefits will accrue whether or not students create a finished product.

**Sentence‐Level Activities: Laying the Foundation for Arguments**

To prepare your students for the challenges of writing argumentative essays, you can give them sentence-level activities that will introduce some of the techniques they'll ultimately use for that type of writing. The conjunction, transition, and sentence expansion activities that follow will also deepen students' comprehension of the curriculum content in which they're embedded and spur them to think analytically about what they've learned.

**Using Conjunctions to Present a Position**

The following examples illustrate how conjunction activities can introduce students to the idea of identifying evidence that supports claims.

When students use _because_, they need to find evidence that supports the proposition given in the sentence stem. When they use _so_, they need to consider what action people should take as a result of that evidence. As always, using the conjunction _but_ may be more challenging because students need to come up with opposing evidence—laying the foundation for pro/con, and, eventually, argumentative writing.

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.

Weather forecasts can be helpful because **_people need to prepare for different conditions_**.

Weather forecasts can be helpful, but **\*they are not always accurate\*\*\***. \*\*

Weather forecasts can be helpful, so **\*it is important to check them regularly\*\*\***. \*\*

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture because **_they can be engineered to resist pests, tolerate_**

**\*harsh conditions, and increase crop yields\*\*\***. \*\*

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, but **_there are concerns about their impact on biodiversity, _**

**\*their potential health risks, and the ethics of genetic manipulation\*\*\***. \*\*

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, so **_it's important to conduct ongoing research and establish_**

**\*regulations to ensure their safe and responsible use\*\*\***. \*\*

**Using Transitions to Introduce and Support Claims**

A transition may begin a sentence, thus creating a link between that sentence and the one that precedes it, or link thoughts within a sentence. When used at the beginning or end of a paragraph, transitions can underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph's various sentences together. And, of course, transitions can and should be used judiciously to connect the paragraphs in a multiple-paragraph essay. These functions are explained in more detail in Chapter 9.

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases _Appendix C_

All five categories of transition words and phrases can be helpful in presenting and evaluating reasons, evidence, and claims (see Appendix C).

Students can learn to use the following types of transitions:

**Time-and-sequence** transitions such as _in addition_, _moreover_, and _finally_ to list reasons and claims on each side **Illustration** transitions such as _for example_ and _specifically_ to provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence **Emphasis** transitions such as _most important_, _moreover_, or _certainly_ to highlight the most important claims or underscore an argument **Change-of-direction** transitions such as _however_, _although_, and _in contrast_ to introduce or acknowledge opposing claims **Conclusion** transitions such as _thus_ or _in the end_ to signal that they're wrapping up an argument Change-of-direction transitions are particularly useful for introducing a contrasting point, example, or argument. They can come in the middle of sentences, as with _but_, or at the beginning of a new sentence, as with _however_. When one paragraph is devoted to a claim and the next to a counterclaim, tell your students they can introduce the second paragraph with a change-of-direction transition such as _on the other hand_.

Another type of change-of-direction transition—the subordinating conjunction—is particularly useful for thesis statements in pro/con or argumentative essays. If students begin their thesis statements with words such as _although_ and _while_, they'll be able to acknowledge two opposing claims. They'll also be able to avoid using the first person ( _I believe_), which can detract from the authority of their argument.

**Using Sentence Expansion to Build Argumentative Skills**

Another sentence-level activity that can be adapted to build argumentative skills is sentence expansion. Remember that sentence expansion involves giving students a kernel sentence—a simple, active, declarative sentence with only one verb—along with the question words to help them expand it.

To make sentence expansion into an argumentative activity, make the kernel sentence you give students one that takes a position. This example is embedded in content from the book _Flowers for Algernon_:1

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence.

His life greatly improved.

Who? **_Charlie_**

When? **_after experimental surgery_**

Why? **\*intelligence\*\*\*** ↑\*\*

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** **_After the experimental surgery, Charlie's life greatly improved because his intelligence_**

**\*increased\*\*\***. \*\*

Then you might also give them a kernel that takes the opposite position. For example:

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence.

His quality of life declined.

Who? **_Charlie_**

When? **_after experimental surgery_**

Why? **_lost friends → lonely_**

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** **_After the experimental surgery, Charlie's quality of life declined because he lost his friends and_**

**\*became lonely\*\*\***. \*\*

**Using Sentence‐Level Activities Together**

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole's second-grade class had been reading about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos as opposed to their natural habitats. To help students understand the debate and work on their writing skills, Ms. Cole gave them sentence stems that required them to supply a logical or evidence-based reason to support the pro-zoo side and explain what followed from that position:

Zoos are good for animals because **\*they protect endangered species from extinction\*\*\***. \*\*

Zoos are good for animals, so **\*people should continue to support them\*\*\***. \*\*

Since many zoos educate visitors about conservation, **\*people learn to respect the environment\*\*\***. \*\*

Then she made the activity more challenging by asking them to consider arguments on the other side:

Zoos are not good for animals because **\*animals should not be removed from their native habitats\*\*\***. \*\*

Zoos are not good for animals, so **\*they should not be supported by the public\*\*\***. \*\*

Since many zoos keep animals in unsafe conditions, **\*animals develop health problems\*\*\***. \*\*

Finally, Ms. Cole asked her students to summarize both positions without taking a side:

Although some people believe that zoos help certain species survive, **\*others argue that animals should not be held captive\*\*\***. \*\*

Next Ms. Cole wanted her students to practice using transition words between sentences. Although the students weren't yet ready to write pro/con paragraphs about zoos, she wanted them to have experience creating the kinds of connections between thoughts that they would need to use during the drafting and revising stages.

Ms. Cole gave her students pairs of sentences that had no transition words connecting them. The students needed to choose an appropriate transition word for each pair and write it in the blank. To provide additional support, Ms. Cole provided a word bank of transition words for her students to choose from. Initially, she gave them sentences that only required them to take one side, either pro or con, like this: If zoos are closed, many animal species may become extinct.

**_For example, _** the numbers of wild gorillas and elephants have decreased because of poachers.

Zoos have improved over the years. **_As a result, _** animals live longer in them and are healthier.

Then she introduced transitions that required students to offer contrasting evidence, laying the groundwork for pro/con and argumentative writing: Some people believe zoos can be good for animals. On the other hand, **\*critics say that animals have better lives in the wild\*\*\***. \*\*

**Level 2 Example**

When his Level 2 history class was studying the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Hidalgo gave them the following sentence stems to develop their argumentative writing skills:

Theodore Roosevelt has many admirers because **\*he established national parks and expanded national forests\*\*\***. \*\*

Mr. Hidalgo then made the activity more challenging by introducing stems that required students to consider both pro and con considerations, such as this one:

Although Theodore Roosevelt moved the United States toward becoming a world power, **_critics argue that Roosevelt had imperialistic_**

**\*tendencies, particularly in his approach to foreign affairs\*\*\***. \*\*

He also had students complete stems in a way that took a position to help them distinguish between pro/con writing and argumentative writing, and to prepare them for the latter:

While critics of Theodore Roosevelt point to his use of military interventions and limited action on civil rights, **_his accomplishments in_**

**\*conservation, foreign affairs, and support of workers' rights are outstanding legacies\*\*\***. \*\*

Mr. Hidalgo had students supply transition words to link sentences about Roosevelt's administration. But because his Level 2 students were more experienced writers, he had them come up with their own transition words rather than giving them a word bank to choose from: Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. **_Consequently, _** he was criticized for interfering in the internal affairs of another country.

Alternatively, Mr. Hidalgo could have given students the transition and had them complete the sentence:

Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. Consequently, **_he was criticized for interfering in the internal_**

**_affairs of another country_**.

**Opinion Writing**

Opinion writing is the least demanding type of writing in this genre because students can present one point of view without bringing in arguments on the other side. For Level 1 writers, an opinion piece can consist of just one paragraph. However, they must do more than simply state their opinions.

They need to back up their opinions with reasons, although their reasons can be based on personal experience rather than evidence.

For example, a student might write an opinion piece arguing that dogs make better pets than cats. She might talk about how loyal, affectionate, and obedient her own dog is. She wouldn't need to bring in and evaluate arguments against dogs (they need to be walked) or in favor of cats (they keep themselves clean).

**Fact versus Opinion: Introducing the Distinction**

It's important for students to develop an understanding of the difference between opinion and fact because opinions won't be enough to support their arguments later on when they're writing pro/con or argumentative essays. They'll need evidence.

You can start introducing students to the fact/opinion distinction in the early elementary grades. In one of our partner schools, for example, a first-grade teacher had her class collectively plan an opinion paragraph explaining why a lot of children love summer. As they came up with a topic sentence and details for the body, the teacher listed the latter in note form on a whiteboard. Then she guided them through the process of coming up with a concluding sentence, producing an outline that looked something like this:

T.S. **\*A lot of students love summer\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_no school or homework_**

2. **_swimming_**

3. **_more time outside_**

4. **_longer days_**

C.S. **_Summer is the best time of the year! _**

During this kind of activity, a teacher can point out that the concluding sentence is an opinion, and the details on the numbered lines are facts that support it.

Some topics don't lend themselves to reasons beyond the author's personal experience. If you ask your students to write an opinion piece about what the best holiday is, they're probably going to list the reasons _they_ like Christmas or Thanksgiving. To help your students develop the skills that will help them write argumentative essays, you'll need to choose topics that lend themselves to reasoned debate, based on facts. **Your students will** **need to have factual information they can draw on to support their opinions. **

**Pro/Con Writing**

Level 2 students may be able to go straight to pro/con compositions, which are a significant step up from opinion pieces. Each body paragraph in the essay presents one side of an issue and the evidence that supports it. A student might write a pro paragraph explaining that the ambition of Alexander the Great was a positive trait because he brought the benefits of Greek civilization to other lands. Then the student could write a con paragraph that it was a negative trait because Alexander's conquest of foreign lands caused so much suffering.

A pro/con essay has an introduction and a conclusion, but—unlike in an argumentative essay—students take a neutral stance, simply presenting the claims and evidence on each side.

**Using Pro or Con SPOs and Paragraphs as Stepping Stones**

Before asking your students to undertake an entire argumentative essay—which would raise two points of view and present evidence for and evaluate each—first give them ample practice planning a single paragraph that summarizes the arguments for a position on one side, backed by evidence.

Next, they can practice planning another single paragraph that summarizes the opposing view—again, backed by evidence. These activities will prepare them to write a pro/con essay that neutrally presents two points of view. The activities will also equip students for the more challenging task of deciding which position is stronger and why, which they'll confront when they write argumentative essays.

It's important to include language like “some argue,” and “others say” in a pro/con essay. If the second half of the sentence just says, “it led him to take actions that caused a great deal of suffering,” the author is making an argument rather than neutrally summarizing claims on both sides—and that kind of writing belongs in an argumentative essay, not a pro/con one.

**Matching Opposing Topic Sentences with Details**

A great way to introduce the skill of constructing arguments on two sides is to provide two SPOs, one pro and one con, that have only the topic sentences filled in. At the top, provide a list of details, in note form, and ask students to match each detail to the appropriate topic sentence. As always, when first introducing students to this activity, model it by guiding the whole class through it orally.

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole gave her class the following activity on zoos. One topic sentence took a pro-zoo position and the other an anti-zoo one. Students had to look at the list of details provided and copy them onto the appropriate dotted lines.

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence.

provide food + water + shelter

captivity → animals distressed

care for injured + abandoned animals

educate visitors/conservation

small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)

no socializing w/ others → bored

protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct

visitors tease animals

T.S. Zoos are harmful to animals and should be abolished.

1. **_small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)_**

2. **_captivity → animals distressed_**

3. **_no socializing w/ others → bored_**

4. **_visitors tease animals_**

T.S. Zoos provide benefits to both animals and people.

1. **_provide food + water + shelter_**

2. **_care for injured + abandoned animals_**

3. **_protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct_**

4. **_educate visitors/conservation_**

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo gave his history class the following activity about the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence.

conservation

not enough progress/civil rts

over-regulated business

treatment of Nat. Amer.

PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression

constructed Panama Canal

supported workers

consumer rts.

T.S. Theodore Roosevelt's presidency was flawed.

1. **_PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression_**

2. **\*not enough progress/civil rts\*\*\***. \*\*

3. **_over-regulated business_**

4. **\*treatment of Nat. Amer\*\*\***. \*\*

T.S. Theodore Roosevelt left a great legacy.

1. **_conservation_**

2. **_supported workers_**

3. **\*constructed Panama\*\*\*** Canal\*\*

4. **_consumer rts_**

By providing details, you're essentially doing the research for your students so they can focus on deciding which evidence supports which claim.

When embedded in the content of the curriculum, this activity will also encourage your students to engage in close reading of texts. They'll need to think carefully to decide which details from the text go with which topic sentence.

Tell your students they should list the strongest reason or evidence last, where it will have the most impact on the reader. That means they'll need to decide which detail provides the strongest argument in support of each claim. This practice evaluating the strength of claims will also prepare students for deciding which position they want to take when it's time to write argumentative essays.

**Creating Pro/Con SPOs from Scratch**

Once students have become familiar with matching details to the appropriate topic sentence and evaluating their strength, they can start creating their own SPOs. Tell them to write a topic sentence and a concluding sentence for each paragraph—pro and con—and write supporting details in note form on the dotted lines of each outline.

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole decided her class was now ready to build on their previous activities by creating their own SPOs on the subject of zoos—one summarizing the pro arguments and the other summarizing the opposing view. To do this, they would need to create topic and concluding sentences.

Since her students were second graders, they hadn't yet been introduced to all three strategies for creating effective topic and concluding sentences—

using one of the sentence types, using an appositive, and using a subordinating conjunction. Ms. Cole had taught them only the first strategy, using one of the four sentence types: a command, a question, an exclamation, or a statement. She reminded them of each type before they began filling out their SPOs.

The following are examples of the SPOs students produced:

T.S. **\*Zoos benefit animals in many ways\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_provide food + water + shelter_**

2. **_care for injured + abandoned animals_**

3. **_protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct_**

4. **_educate visitors/conservation_**

C.S. **\*Zoos keep animals safe and help them survive\*\*\***. \*\*

T.S. **\*It is cruel to keep animals in zoos\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_small exhibits/little place to roam (e.g., elephants)_**

2. **_captivity → animals distressed_**

3. **_could never survive in the wild_**

4. **_visitors tease animals_**

C.S. **_Boycott zoos! _**

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo also had his history students plan their own pro/con SPOs on Theodore Roosevelt. He required his students to come up with different topic sentences than the ones he had supplied for the matching activity, and he reminded them of the three strategies to create one.

Similarly, he required students to come up with some different details than the ones he had provided. He reminded them to include the sources for the details in note form so that they would be able to provide citations or incorporate quotations from the text if and when they turned their SPOs into paragraphs.

T.S. **\*Theodore Roosevelt's presidency had shortcomings\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_used force to achieve foreign policy_**

2. **_over-regulated business_**

3. **_not enough progress/civil rts_**

4. **_treatment of Nat. Americans_**

C.S. **\*Although Theodore Roosevelt accomplished a great deal, his presidency was flawed\*\*\***. \*\*

T.S. **\*Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, had a positive impact on the United States\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_nat'l parks + exp. forests_**

2. **_labor unions_**

3. **_constructed Panama Canal_**

4. **_consumer rts/Food and Drug Administration_**

C.S. **\*In conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt left an impressive record of accomplishments\*\*\***. \*\*

**TOs and MPOs for Pro/Con Compositions**

The next phase in developing the skills necessary for the argumentative essay is to have students create a TO or MPO that considers both sides but doesn't take a position. To do that, they can build on their existing pro and con SPOs or use a new topic.

As we discussed in Chapter 9, the first steps in creating TOs and MPOs are for you to select a topic and lead the students in developing a thesis

statement. If students are choosing a new topic at this point, make sure that it's both debatable and manageable—neither too broad nor too narrow.

Ask yourself if students will be able to handle the amount of evidence or research required.

A TO or MPO for a pro/con essay might look something like the ones in Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2:

**Exhibit 10.2**

As always, the TO and the MPO will differ in what they require of students. In a pro/con TO, students will write thesis and concluding statements that consist of one sentence acknowledging that there are arguments on both sides. A thesis statement might be:

**\*There are arguments for and against increasing the minimum wage\*\*\***. \*\*

Alternatively, students can construct a thesis or concluding statement for a pro/con essay that makes use of a subordinating conjunction:

**_Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on many small businesses, others_**

**\*claim that an increased wage would be beneficial to many households\*\*\***. \*\*

Remember that if students leave out a phrase like “others claim that,” they're constructing a thesis statement for an _argumentative_ essay, not a pro/con essay. A thesis statement for an argumentative essay would read like this:

**_Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, an increased_**

**\*wage would be beneficial to many households\*\*\***. \*\*

This thesis statement signals that the author has considered the evidence on both sides, has come to a conclusion about which side makes more sense, and is prepared to defend that conclusion with evidence. You can introduce your students to the distinction between pro/con and argumentative thesis statements at this point, but if they haven't had sufficient practice with pro/con essays, they may not be ready to move on to argumentative writing.

If students are developing an MPO rather than a TO, they'll need to construct a thesis statement but not a concluding statement. When they write their draft, they'll create general and specific statements for their introductory and concluding paragraphs, along with a reworded thesis statement to use in the latter.

**The Argumentative Essay**

An argumentative essay has to be both persuasive and fair. Students will need to convince the reader that their own position is the stronger one but, at the same time, present the opposing point of view accurately. Their experience writing neutral pro/con essays will help them with the latter task.

Composing argumentative essays will enhance skills that your students will generally find useful in later life, in the workplace, and personally.

**Of all the writing genres, argumentative writing will be the most effective at sharpening students' analytical faculties. Learning** **to construct and defend an argument will enable them to think logically and critically. **

**Using an MPO to Plan an Argumentative Essay**

Before your students can start creating an MPO for an argumentative essay, they have to decide which position they're taking. To do that, they'll need to understand the facts and evidence on both sides. Be sure that the class has spent ample time studying and discussing the topic first.

Students need to know that when creating a thesis statement for an argumentative essay, they should put the argument they're making last. For example, if a student wants to argue that the Industrial Revolution was essentially a positive development, they would _not_ write: Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, its drawbacks cannot be ignored.

Instead, they would end the sentence with the point that the Industrial Revolution brought benefits, as in this sentence: Although the Industrial Revolution had its drawbacks, the many benefits it brought cannot be ignored.

In addition to the introductory and concluding paragraphs—which will use the GST and TSG structures—the essay will have three or more body paragraphs (see Exhibit 10.3).

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction GST

**2nd paragraph. ** Lays out the background of the issue accurately, but presents evidence in a way that tends to support the author's position.

**3rd paragraph. ** Presents the counterclaim and the evidence to support it.

**4th paragraph. ** Provides the strongest evidence for the author's point of view.

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion TSG

**Exhibit 10.3**

The standard argumentative essay often consists of five or more paragraphs, although this is not always a requirement. However, when your students begin to write these essays, you may decide to limit them to four paragraphs. They will omit the paragraph right after the introduction that lays out the problem and introduces their own argument. Instead they'll have only two body paragraphs: the first presenting the counterclaim and evidence and the second presenting their own claim and evidence.

**Students should not attempt to raise a claim and rebut it in the same paragraph. ** In our experience, that approach often leads to a fragmented and confusing presentation of the information.

**Incorporating Evidence and Quotations**

Since students are unlikely to be experts in the topics they're writing about, they'll need to introduce citations, paraphrases, and quotations. Although they should cite authorities supporting both sides, they'll need to show why those who support their own side are more convincing.

At the MPO stage, your students won't actually be incorporating complete citations and quotations, but they will be making notations on their outlines referring to them. Later, they'll integrate that evidence as footnotes and references when they convert their MPOs into drafts and final copies. To prepare your students for that task, have them practice introducing quotations and other evidence in a way that supports a claim (see

Chapter 9).

Certain words are particularly well suited to framing quotations or paraphrases in argumentative writing. When introducing a quotation or summary that supports their claim, students should characterize the source in a way that indicates its authority and uses stronger verbs than _says_ or even _believes_ to introduce the statement. More powerful verbs include _endorses_, _asserts_, _emphasizes_, _reminds us_, and _affirms_.

For example, a student seeking authority in arguing against harsh forms of juvenile justice could simply write the following: Professor Clarke said, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.”

Think how much more mileage the student could get out of that quotation by framing it with an appositive that indicates the speaker's authority and using a verb that links the speaker's ideas to the student's own point of views, such as:

Professor Clarke, a nationally recognized expert on juvenile justice reform, endorses this view when she writes, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.”

Illustration transitions are also effective ways to introduce textual evidence and quotations, as shown here:

Experts in the field of juvenile justice reform agree that harsh measures don't work. **For example, ** Professor Clarke has written that boot camps

“have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.”

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo felt that his students were now ready not only to summarize the arguments on both sides of the debate, but also to take a position and evaluate claims on the other side. He asked his students to think carefully about the arguments on each side and then choose the position they

personally felt was stronger. Their next task was to craft a thesis statement that stated their position and acknowledged a counterclaim.

He also wanted his students to start citing sources for their evidence and quotations, so he told them to be sure to note them on the details lines of

their MPOs. Exhibit 10.4 shows the MPO that one of his students produced.

**Differentiating Argumentative Assignments**

Level 1 students are not yet experienced enough to plan and write argumentative essays. Therefore, they should keep practicing opinion and pro/con pieces until they've developed the skills necessary for tasks like writing general, specific, and thesis statements; engaging in research; and distinguishing between stronger and weaker arguments.

However, you may be teaching a class where some Level 2 students are ready to plan argumentative essays using the MPO and others should instead use the TO. Those using the TO will not need to create general and specific statements, and they may not dive as deeply into the evidence, but they will be acquiring skills that will enable them to write more fully fleshed-out argumentative essays in the future.

**Argumentative Terms**

As students move to more sophisticated expository and argumentative writing, consider giving them lists of words that are geared to those types of writing. For

example, topic sentences using words such as _although_ or _while_ work particularly well for both pro/con and argumentative writing.

This would be a good point to introduce your students to words that will come in handy in presenting arguments that are made by others. For example, they can describe those on one side as _proponents_ and those on the other as _naysayers_. Instead of simply using the verb _said_, they can use verbs such as _argue_ and _maintain_.

**EXAMPLES:**

Defenders of Theodore Roosevelt argue….

Critics of Theodore Roosevelt assert….

Exhibit 10.5 provides a list of terms to help students craft their pro/con and argumentative TO and MPO thesis statements.

**Review: Argumentative Writing Activities**

If you're a middle or high school teacher, the following scaffolds will help you guide your students through the activities that lead to the crafting of an argumentative essay. These activities will enable students to organize their material more effectively, think more analytically, and write more coherently as they prepare to tackle argumentative assignments.

If you're an elementary teacher, your students are probably not yet ready to create argumentative essays. However, if you use the activities leading up to pro/con essays, you'll be laying the foundation for their ability to write argumentative essays at higher grade levels.

**SENTENCE‐LEVEL STRATEGIES**

Use _because-but-so_ activities to present students with a sentence stem that takes a position and have them: Connect a claim to evidence ( _because_), introduce a counterclaim ( _but_), and describe cause/effect relationships ( _so_).

Use subordinating conjunctions ( _while_, _although_, and _even though_) to write sentences that acknowledge a counterclaim and state a claim.

Use sentence-expansion activities to present students with a kernel sentence that takes a position.

Use transition activities to present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims.

**SINGLE‐PARAGRAPH OUTLINE**

Practice writing topic sentences for paragraphs that summarize a position on one side of an issue, using the three strategies for creating them: Sentence type (a statement expressing the position of advocates)

Subordinating conjunction

Appositive

Match topic sentences taking opposing positions with appropriate details.

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes a position, backed by evidence.

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes an opposing view, also backed by evidence.

**TO AND MPO: PRO/CON**

Practice writing a pro/con thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument without taking a position for a TO (e.g., “Although there are many who argue that an extended school year will benefit students, opponents believe that additional time will not produce meaningful results”).

Write a complete pro/con TO or MPO that presents the evidence for two sides of an argument without taking a position.

**MPO: ARGUMENT (FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL 2 STUDENTS)**

_Some students in a class might be ready for the argumentative essay but not yet ready for the MPO, in which case they should use the TO_.

Practice writing an argumentative thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument and takes a position, placing the author's position at the end of the thesis statement (e.g., “Although extending the school year has many drawbacks, its benefits outweigh them”).

Develop a four- or five-paragraph MPO that lays out two sides of an argument and takes a position.

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction: Write only “GST” in the Details box. The thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence on the solid line above the outline.

**2nd paragraph. ** Lay out the background of the issue accurately, but in a way that tends to support the author's position. (When students are first being introduced to the argumentative MPO, they may omit this paragraph.)

**3rd paragraph. ** Present the counterclaim and the evidence to support it.

**4th paragraph. ** Provide the strongest evidence for the author's point of view.

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion: Write only “TSG.”

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

Generate general and specific statements.

Practice using transition words and phrases to present and evaluate reasons and claims:

Time and sequence: List reasons and claims on each side.

Illustration: Provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence.

Emphasis: Highlight important claims or underscore an argument.

Change of direction: Introduce or acknowledge opposing claims.

Conclusion: Signal wrapping up an argument.

Practice activities that introduce and explain a quotation in a way that supports a claim.

**To Sum Up**

To be able to plan and write an effective argumentative essay, your students will need to be able to do the following: Understand the difference between fact and opinion.

Use nouns and verbs that are well suited to argumentative writing (see Exhibit 10.5).

Integrate quotations with appropriate introductions and explanations.

Use the SPO to plan two separate paragraphs presenting opposing points of view and evidence to support them.

Use the TO to plan pro/con essays that present two points of view and supporting evidence in a neutral manner.

Use the MPO (or TO) to plan four- or five-paragraph argumentative essays that take a position backed by evidence.

Determine which piece(s) of evidence is (are) the strongest and therefore should be mentioned last.

# CHAPTER 11

**A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students' Writing**

Mya was a third grader at a school with a high-poverty population. Over 75% of students came from socioeconomically disadvantaged families, and Mya was one of them.

At the beginning of the year, Mya's teacher, Mr. Corwin, gave his students a prompt to gauge their writing skills. Exhibit 11.1 shows what Mya

wrote.

**Exhibit 11.1**

The paragraph had no particular structure. In fact, it was just one long run-on sentence. It sounded just like Mya did when she spoke in class.

Mya's school was partnering with The Writing Revolution organization, and Mr. Corwin got training in the Hochman Method from the organization's faculty. Over the course of the year, he was able to teach his students how to construct sentences and outline paragraphs.

At the end of the year, Mr. Corwin gave Mya and her classmates another prompt, to see how their writing skills had progressed. Mya's SPO

and paragraph are shown in Exhibits 11.2 and 11.3.

**Exhibit 11.2**

**Exhibit 11.3**

Mr. Corwin realized that Mya still had a few things to learn about writing. But when he looked back at her beginning-of-the-year writing sample, he was struck by the differences he saw. Her paragraph now had a clear structure, with a topic and concluding sentence and supporting details. Her sentences were complete and didn't run on indefinitely. She was able to use transitions to connect her thoughts. And she had learned how to use subordinating conjunctions.

Mya's response to a writing prompt at the beginning of the year had provided her teacher with guidance on what skills she already had and what she needed to learn. And her end-of-year response revealed—to her and to Mr. Corwin—how far she had come in just one school year.

**Don't Guess—Assess! **

**WHY ASSESS YOUR STUDENTS' WRITING? **

Enables you to pinpoint skills individual students have or need to acquire

Provides information about the skills you need to focus on for your class as a whole

Helps you set goals for individual students and your class

Tracks the progress your students make over the course of the year

**Using Writing to Monitor Learning**

The strategies and activities you have read about in this book teach students writing skills and guide them to acquire knowledge on a daily basis. As you have probably noticed, they also have great value in revealing how much students are learning, not only about writing skills, but also about the material they are studying. In other words, these activities serve as **formative assessments**. They will help you to monitor your students'

comprehension of material that has been taught, determine your next instructional steps, and enable you to provide explicit, effective feedback that will move students forward.

In many schools, particularly at the elementary level, students' progress in literacy is measured by periodic “benchmark” assessments designed to evaluate general comprehension skills like “finding the main idea” of a text. Studies have found that such tests are highly unreliable. In one study, about a thousand children took four different standardized measures of comprehension. Researchers found that the odds of any two tests identifying the same student as a poor reader or a high-achieving one were less than half.1

And because the reading passages on the tests are unrelated to topics in the curriculum, the tests also don't even attempt to assess what students have learned about any content they may have been taught. Writing activities like those described in this book can be a far more reliable and accurate measure of learning—for students, their parents, and their teachers.

Formative assessments have other advantages as well. When students get prompt and regular feedback, they have a clearer sense of what they've accomplished and what they still need to work on.

In addition, research has shown that when formative assessment is done frequently, it's one of the most effective ways to enable students to transfer information to long-term memory—a key step in learning. 2

Here is an example of formative assessment if your class has read _Night_.3

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.

The prisoners are forced on a death march because **_they have to evacuate the concentration camp. _**

The prisoners are forced on a death march, but **_Eliezer manages to survive. _**

The prisoners are forced on a death march, so **_most die from fatigue, disease, and the bitter cold weather. _**

**Summative assessments**, which occur at the end of a unit of study, measure what learning students have gained over a period of time—at least in theory. When standardized state reading tests are used as summative assessments, they rarely serve that purpose. They usually do not measure the writing skills you have taught, and, as with standardized benchmark assessments, the content of the passages is unlikely to align to the content of the curriculum you're using. In any event, the results are generally not available until months after the tests have been administered. It makes far more sense to use summative assessments, including those that require written responses, grounded in content that has actually been taught.

**Periodic Assessments to Monitor Writing Progress**

In addition to using TWR activities to monitor your students' progress in learning content you have taught, you should also give periodic assessments specifically aimed at measuring their progress in acquiring writing skills.

For these kinds of assessments, provide prompts on generic topics that give you a sense of where your students are in relation to each other, what their general strengths and weaknesses are, and what your goals for writing instruction should be.

At the beginning, middle, and end of the school year, it's important to assess:

What skills have been transferred to independent writing

What skills your students need to acquire

You should give your students a simple prompt without providing guidance or assistance. Be sure the topic is one that your students know well enough to write about coherently. All your students should have the same prompt so that it will be easier for you to analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

A prompt can consist of a single word or a brief phrase. Some prompts we have found to be useful are:

Friends (or friendship or how to make/keep friends)

Hopes for the future

Role model

Special gift or possession

Personal goals

Favorite season

Favorite pastime

Why do we study the past? \*

- For older students.

One of the skills you are evaluating is a student's ability to write a topic sentence, so avoid prompts that provide a “sentence starter.” If the prompt is

“a great school trip,” for example, many students will start the assignment with those four words. Simple phrases such as “school trip” or “role model” make better prompts.

Alternatively, you can provide more explanation. For example, rather than simply asking students to write about “a role model,” you could give them the following paragraph:

_A role model is someone you admire for having qualities you would like to have. A role model is a person whose behavior or achievements you_ _respect. Think about someone you consider a role model, and write about why that person is special to you. You may choose someone you know_ _or someone you have read about. You may choose someone who is alive today or someone who is no longer here but has made a lasting_ _impression on you_.

Another word of caution: try to avoid prompts that are apt to yield lists, such as “winning the lottery” or “my favorite things.”

Many other subjects could work well as prompts, and you, as the teacher, are the best judge of what your particular students are likely to be able to write about.

You may not want to use the same prompt for all three writing assessments at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. However, it can provide a clearer basis for comparison if you stay with the same general topic. For example:

**Beginning of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or more interesting parts of [previous grade level]. Describe at least two.

**Middle of the year:**

Write a paragraph about which subject is your favorite and why. Give two or three reasons.

**End of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or most interesting parts of [ending grade level]. Describe at least two.

**How to Administer Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

When you are administering the assessment, the first step is to **explain the purpose of the activity**. Let your students know that the assessment will help you understand where they need help to further develop their writing skills. Remind them to do their best work so you'll be able to see what they already know how to do and what they still need help with.

To get an accurate picture of what students can do independently, try not to give them any help during the assessment. If a student has difficulty spelling a word, for example, ask him to make his best guess and provide the correct spelling only if he's unable to continue. If a student just can't get started, you might have to provide her with a general suggestion or a topic sentence. **If you do need to provide students with help, be sure to** **note on the assessment exactly what was done with teacher support. **

Your **instructions must be explicit**. First, make it clear that students should keep their writing samples brief. If you're teaching first graders, you may want to tell them that it's fine to write just a sentence or two. Even with older Level 1 and some Level 2 students, it's best to limit the samples to a single paragraph. You'll be asking them to revise and edit their work later, and that may feel overwhelming if they've written at length.

**If students have learned how to develop an SPO, be sure to remind them to complete one before writing so that you can assess** **their outlining skills. ** If Level 2 students have been taught to develop Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (TOs and MPOs), you might allow them to write up to three paragraphs—after completing an outline, of course. Be sure that students' outlines are attached to their writing samples.

Typically, these assessments will take no more than one class period to complete, but some students may take less time. **Return the assessment** **samples to students in the next day or two and ask them to revise and edit their work. ** Tell them that the best writers often find ways to improve and correct their work and that it's important for you to see what they would like to change in their writing.

**It's not necessary to have students make final copies of the assessment, unless the revised and edited version is illegible. **

When the allotted time for revision and editing is up, collect the students' samples and date them. After assessing a student's work, put it in a dedicated folder so you can monitor individual progress.

**How to Evaluate Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

As we noted in Chapter 6, the following four criteria are generally used to assess writing quality.

**STRUCTURE**

Are the sentences in the paragraph, or the paragraphs in a longer composition, arranged appropriately?

**COHERENCE**

Are the sentences (and paragraphs) logically related to one another?

**UNITY**

Does every sentence support the main idea of the paragraph?

Does every paragraph support the main idea of the composition?

**WELL‐CONSTRUCTED SENTENCES**

Are the sentences grammatically correct and clear?

Are there compound and complex sentences in addition to simple, active ones?

Do the sentences begin in a variety of ways?

Judging the quality of student writing may be one of the most difficult tasks in all of educational assessment. Some aspects of writing are easy to quantify—total number of words or sentences, sentence length, spelling, or proper grammar and usage—but others are highly subjective.

Even experts have disagreed on the best way to go about measuring writing quality. “Over the years,” one team of experts has written, “writing assessment research and practice has suffered from dissension at every point, on almost every feature of stimulating, producing, evaluating, and teaching writing.” 4

Several factors can interfere with the accuracy of writing assessments:

**Decoding. ** When students are asked to write in response to a written prompt, some may have difficulty decoding it.

**Background information. ** Lack of knowledge about the topic causes some students to have trouble understanding the prompt and/or producing a response.

**Computers. ** If students write their responses on computers, those who are comfortable using computers will have an advantage over those who aren't.

**Mechanical errors. ** There are questions about how much weight to give to errors in capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and grammar.

Although students need to master these aspects of writing, technical mistakes can be distracting and lead teachers to overlook the progress students may have made in organizing their ideas or using complex sentence structures.

**Handwriting. ** Poor handwriting often has a negative influence on the evaluator. We'll address the subject of handwriting in more detail later in this chapter.

**RESOURCE**

Writing Assessment Checklists _Appendix F_

The **Writing Assessment Checklists** (Appendix F) can't entirely eliminate the difficulties involved in evaluating writing, but they can provide

guidelines for more accurate judgments, grounded in strategies you have taught. They will tell you where each student stands and can be filled out fairly quickly.

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Although there's been disagreement among experts about the best way to evaluate students' writing, one meta-analysis of 136 studies of

writing assessment came up with some recommendations.5 They make the most sense when applied to students above third grade, when

most have already acquired the basic mechanics of writing.

Use assessments to provide students with feedback about the effectiveness of their writing.

Teach students how to evaluate the effectiveness of their own writing.

Monitor students' progress in writing on an ongoing basis.

The report also listed six best practices in writing assessment:

**Allow students to use either paper or computers to write—or have them use the medium you know they're used to. **

Studies have shown that students who use computers score better than those who write by hand—unless they have little experience using a computer to write, in which case they score worse.

**Try not to judge a writing sample on the basis of the student's handwriting. **

**Mask the students' identities when scoring papers**. Teachers may subconsciously give a student a higher or lower score depending on the quality of her previous work or her race, gender, or ethnicity. One easy way to guard against implicit bias is to have students put their names on the back of a paper rather than the front.

**Put students' papers in random order before scoring them**. Some studies have suggested that raters' scores will vary depending on the quality of the essays they've just read. If a rater has just read a series of high-quality essays, she's more likely to give the next piece of writing she reads a lower score—and vice versa.

**Collect multiple samples of each student's work. ** The quality of a student's writing often varies with the type of composition.

Some are better at writing narratives, and others may excel at argumentative or informational essays.

**Try to ensure the reliability of your scoring. ** Much of what goes into scoring a piece of writing is subjective. To control for that, schools can offer training for teachers on how to assess writing. Administrators can provide benchmark descriptions or examples for each point on a scale, have multiple teachers score each paper, and base scores on more than one writing task.

**Comparative Judgment: Another Way of Assessing Writing Quality**

An interesting approach to evaluating writing offers hope that the task will become easier. This method, offered through a British organization called No More Marking, is both more efficient and more reliable than standard methods. The method, called _comparative judgment_, involves having readers compare two pieces of student writing and decide which one is better. Studies have shown that when many such gut-level comparisons are

aggregated, the judgments are highly consistent.6

At TWR partner schools, teachers may use comparative judgment to assess writing progress. Usually the judging is done within a single grade level by teachers of that grade. Student names are not visible, and judging can be done anonymously.

After judging the writing samples, teachers discuss trends they are noticing across the grade, which informs their next steps for instruction. For example, if teachers notice that many students are not beginning their paragraphs with topic sentences, they can practice using the SPO and the scaffolding activities as a whole class to reinforce this skill.

Since assessment using comparative judgment takes far less time than other methods of evaluating student writing, teachers have the opportunity to see the writing of a broader range of students than is typical with other rating methods, enabling them to gain perspective that is both deeper and wider on strengths and areas that need improvement.

No More Marking provides lots of valuable data about how students are doing. Once teachers have that data, the Hochman Method provides the specific strategies that teachers can use to address the weaknesses in student writing that it identifies.

**Having Students Write in Response to What They've Read**

Many teachers have their students write in response to a specific passage rather than the general prompts we have recommended. There are some benefits, but also potential pitfalls to this approach.

**The Pros and the Cons**

Having students write about a passage they're given simulates more closely the kind of writing students will be asked to do on state assessments toward the end of the school year. Generally, state literacy tests give students a passage to read and ask them to write in response to it, citing evidence from the text. The tests may also ask students to read two different texts and compare them.

It's important to understand that using texts as a basis for writing assessments brings its own potential problems. Students may have trouble decoding the texts, or they may lack the background knowledge that would enable them to understand them—especially if the texts don't relate to content covered in the curriculum. If that's the case, the assessment will not be accurately measuring your students' writing skills.

**Handwriting Matters**

One significant problem as students draft and revise their paragraphs and compositions or take tests is the poor quality of their handwriting.

Although research hasn't established that using cursive confers cognitive benefits, it's clear there are other reasons to teach students how to use it.

Good handwriting—including well-formed cursive—can influence a reader's evaluation of the quality of a piece of writing. In addition, students who have never learned or don't use cursive are often unable to read documents, letters, and notes written in cursive. This can prove to be a disadvantage in reading certain text and in communicating with others. 7

Studies do indicate that it's important for children to have handwriting instruction of some kind as opposed to only learning to touch type on a computer. When students engage in the physical activity of carefully shaping letters, it increases their ability to recognize letters, promotes their

recall of words, and improves their spelling accuracy.8

Many schools no longer focus on handwriting instruction, whether cursive or printing. That has led to random acts of capitalization as well as to the failure on the part of many students to leave enough space between words.

**Maintaining Student Portfolios**

It's a good idea to keep a folder or portfolio of samples of each student's work and assessments throughout the year. This collection of a student's writing can provide a dramatic reminder of the progress a student has made—progress that otherwise might be overlooked. It also provides valuable information for the teacher who has the student the following year.

**To Sum Up**

When assessing student writing, be aware of the factors that can interfere with an accurate picture—such as a student's difficulty decoding or understanding the text used as a prompt and the frequency of mechanical errors.

Administer writing assessments in response to a prompt or a text three times a year to measure students' independent writing ability.

Assess students' ability to develop outlines.

Assess students' ability to revise and edit their work by allowing them to do so a day or two after the assessment is administered.

Use the Writing Assessment Checklists to record individual students' progress and that of the class as a whole.

Use data from assessments to help set your objectives for the class as a whole and differentiate instruction to meet students' individual needs.

Maintain a folder or portfolio of each student's work to track progress made over the year.

# CHAPTER 12

**Revolutionizing Learning: Embedding Writing Activities into Content**

Throughout this book we've given you reminders that unless you're introducing a new TWR strategy, writing activities and assignments should be embedded in the content you're teaching. If you're teaching about the Aztec Empire, for example, your writing activities, including sentence-level work, should be about the Aztec Empire. When you adapt TWR strategies to your particular content, you will be drawing on and reinforcing knowledge of the material your students have been reading and discussing.

It's also far more effective to weave writing into regular instruction and embed it in curricular content than to teach it in a separate writing block.

Rather than having to transfer skills they've acquired while writing about something that has nothing to do with the curriculum—a transfer that often doesn't happen—your students will be developing skills and content knowledge simultaneously. **Writing isn't just a skill. Writing instruction** **can also be a powerful tool for teaching content. **

Keep in mind that the _content_ of TWR activities is what drives their rigor: the same strategy can challenge students at different grade levels, depending on the content. For example, if you've been teaching kindergarteners about butterflies, you might have them do a _because-but-so_ activity orally on caterpillars and cocoons. If you're teaching an AP American History class, you can also give your high school students a _because-but-so_ activity—but you'll have them do it in written form and focus on the effectiveness of the New Deal. The format of the exercise is the same, but the latter activity is obviously far more rigorous.

Similarly, the principles of organizing and planning Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs) don't differ significantly from one grade level or ability level to another. It's the content that makes the task more challenging.

**Using Strategies Concurrently**

One way to have students keep practicing strategies you've already taught is to bring in several different strategies while teaching a single book or topic. This is, in fact, the optimal way to use the strategies once your students have become familiar with several of them.

The following examples illustrate how to use this approach with Level 1 and Level 2 students. In both cases, the strategies help students develop their writing or prewriting skills while simultaneously deepening their understanding of content.

**Level 1 Examples**

If your class has read _Henry's Freedom Box_, 1 consider the following activity:

Henry didn't know his birthday because **_no one kept records of enslaved people's birthdays. _**

Henry got married and had three children, but **\*his family was separated and sold\*\*\***. \*\*

Henry survived his journey in the small crate for 27 hours. As a result, **_he arrived in Philadelphia where he finally could be free. _**

You could also have students develop a Single-Paragraph Outline:

T.S. **\*Henry's Freedom Box, a true story, has won many awards\*\*\***. \*\*

1. **_Richmond VA / sep from mother/ worked in factory_**

2. **_marries → 3 children / family sold_**

3. **_mails himself in small crate / 27 hrs. _**

4. **_in Philadelphia Henry a free man_**

C.S. **\*Henry was brave and determined in spite of terrible struggles\*\*\***. \*\*

**Level 2 Examples**

If your class has been studying Sumer, Babylon, and Hammurabi, you might give them the following _because-but-so_ activity—shown with possible student responses:

Hammurabi created a written code of laws because **_he wanted to impose order on Babylon. _**

Hammurabi created a written code of laws, but **_many Babylonians couldn't read them. _**

Hammurabi created a written code of laws, so **_there was a decrease in crime. _**

You could also have students develop test questions about the content using expository terms:

1. **_Explain the purpose of a written code of laws. _**

2. **_Enumerate the reasons for creating a code of laws. _**

3. **_Describe how social class influenced punishments. _**

Next, you could give your students sentence stems beginning with subordinating conjunctions and have them develop complete sentences, as in the following examples:

If Hammurabi had not developed a written code of laws, **_he would have failed to unite Babylonia. _**

Although Sumer's city-states were defeated, **_the Babylonian Empire adopted many of their ideas and practices. _**

If students have been introduced to SPOs, have them complete an SPO. More able students can go on to convert the outline into a paragraph.

T.S. **_Sumer, an ancient Mesopotamian civilization, is lauded for the lasting impact of its innovations. _**

1. **_cuneiform = system of writing/maps & sci info_**

2. **_# system → basis today for measuring time_**

3. **_architectural structures (arches, columns, ramps)_**

4. **_written code of laws_**

C.S. **_The contributions of Sumer had a major influence on later civilizations. _**

**Using TWR Strategies to “Revolutionize” Your Materials**

Most textbooks and other instructional materials provide end-of-chapter or end-of-unit comprehension questions that don't reflect TWR strategies.

Usually, you'll be able to draw on your knowledge of TWR's method to make those activities more powerful and reinforce the writing instruction you've been providing. Here are some Level 1 and 2 examples.

**Level 1 Examples**

If your class has read _The Cricket in Times Square_, 2 they may have been asked to complete an activity like this one: **Original Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.

1. Why was Chester worried about being in New York City?

2. What did Tucker do to make him feel better?

3. Where did Tucker take Chester?

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the sentences using _because, but_, and _so_.

Chester was worried about being in New York City because

Chester was worried about being in New York City, but

Chester was worried about being in New York City, so

If your class has been learning about rainforest animals and plants, they may have been asked to complete an activity like this one: **Original Activity**

Instead, students can be asked to complete the following revolutionized activity:

**Revolutionized Activity**

**DIRECTIONS:** Using key words and phrases, write details for the given topic sentence.

T.S. **_Rainforest animals and plants interact in many ways that are important for maintaining a balanced ecosystem. _**

1.

2.

3.

4.

**Level 2 Example**

After studying different types of subatomic particles, students were asked the following questions:

**DIRECTIONS:** Answer the following questions.

1. What types of subatomic particles does an atom contain?

2. Why are electrons attracted to positive objects?

3. How do protons behave?

4. What does neutral mean?

The teacher “revolutionized” the questions in the following way:

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the second sentence following the transition word.

1. An atom contains three types of subatomic particles. Specifically,

2. Electrons have a negative charge. As a result,

3. Protons repel each other. However,

4. The neutron is neutral. In other words,

**How to Use TWR to Differentiate Your Instruction**

Most classrooms encompass a range of student ability—sometimes a wide range. One of the most challenging aspects of teaching is accommodating all of those levels without going over some students' heads while boring others.

**Keep an Eye Out for Struggling Students**

As we've demonstrated throughout this book, TWR activities easily lend themselves to differentiation. It's not necessary to come up with a completely different version of the activities or use different content for students of varying abilities—in fact, that approach risks leaving struggling students permanently behind. What's important is that you have a clear idea of what students are supposed to be learning and activities that will give you a good sense of whether all students have mastered it. 3

**Modify the Same Strategy for Students at Different Levels**

We've described throughout this book how you can differentiate many of the strategies as we've introduced them. But to recap, here are some examples:

**Sentence expansion. ** Ask fewer question words of students who are having difficulty. For example, give all students a kernel such as “They rebelled,” but ask some students _who, when, why, _ and _where_ while asking others only _who_ and _when_.

**Because-but-so. ** Give all students the same stem—for example, “The British invaded the colonies”—but ask some students to provide complete sentences for all three conjunctions while asking others to write a sentence for only one or two conjunctions.

**Appositives. ** Ask all students to supply an appositive to describe a person, place, or thing, but give some students a list of words and phrases to choose from.

**Sentence-combining. ** Give all students a group of short sentences to combine into one longer one, but provide some students with fewer sentences to combine.

**Unelaborated paragraph revision. ** Give all students the same bare-bones paragraph, but give some students fewer instructions on how to revise it. For example, you might give some students a list of six things to do and limit others to only one or two, such as “Improve T.S. and C.S.”

**SPOs. ** Have all students complete an SPO, but provide some students with the topic or the concluding sentence while asking others to come up with those sentences independently. You might also require some students to use only key words and phrases for their notes on the dotted lines, while others use abbreviations and symbols as well.

**TOs or MPOs. ** Have all students complete a TO or MPO, but provide some students with the categories they'll need to organize their paragraphs while having others come up with their own categories.

**MPOs. ** When students are converting an MPO into a draft, you can also provide some students with the general or specific statements to include in their introduction and conclusion.

**To Sum Up**

By weaving TWR activities into regular instruction and embedding them in curricular content, you'll be able to use writing instruction as a powerful teaching tool.

Use several strategies concurrently while teaching any topic.

Differentiate TWR activities for students who are struggling or are racing ahead, without altering the basic form of the activity or using different content.

Transform open-ended questions in your instructional materials into more focused activities using strategies from The Writing Revolution.

## BOOK DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. **Choose a topic (e.g., a science topic, book chapter, current event) and devise activities on that topic for your grade level** **using: \*because, but\*\*\***, and \*so**\***; sentence expansion; subordinating conjunctions; and an SPO, TO, or MPO. \*\*

2. **Why do the TWR strategies assess student comprehension more accurately than typical end-of-unit textbook questions? **

# CHAPTER 13

**Putting the Method into Practice: Leave No Strategy Behind**

Throughout this book, we present TWR strategies in a linear fashion. But in practice, you should **not** aim to get all students to master a particular strategy and then move on, leaving that strategy behind. Since content and writing skills are so interconnected, “mastery” will depend as much on the content you're teaching as on any particular strategy. In addition, bringing back strategies you've already covered will help remind students to use them in their writing.

As a result, it's best to keep moving through your curricular sequence, continuously bringing previously taught strategies into your instruction and using them alongside others that you're introducing. As you move along, you can always modify strategies for students who are struggling.

**Laying a Strong Foundation: Sentence‐Level Activities**

As we pointed out in Chapter 2, sentences are the foundation for all writing. If students haven't learned to write a clear, coherent sentence, they'll

never be able to write a clear, coherent paragraph or essay. And sentence-level activities can be just as challenging for students as lengthier writing assignments—sometimes even more challenging. Whether students are writing a sentence, paragraph, or composition, the content drives the rigor.

All students, regardless of their grade or ability level, need to practice crafting various kinds of sentences. Throughout this book, you've seen multiple examples of TWR sentence activities for all levels and in all subjects.

If you're teaching beginning writers, English language learners, students with learning disabilities, or the many students who write the way they speak, the first step is to make sure they understand what a sentence is. As we noted in Chapter 1, simply getting them to repeat an abstract definition, such as “a sentence has a subject and predicate and expressses a complete thought,” is unlikely to be enough. They will need ample practice in distinguishing between complete sentences and fragments—and turning fragments into complete sentences. They'll also need practice in correcting run-on sentences.

Even if your students are more proficient writers, it is still important to introduce them to the whole range of TWR sentence strategies. The difference is that your pace can be faster. Level 2 students can do much of their sentence-level work in the context of expanding unelaborated paragraphs and improving their own writing in response to your specific feedback as they draft, revise, and edit. These students will also benefit from sentence activities used as comprehension checks on tests, quizzes, and exit slips.

Generally, all students, regardless of grade level, should practice at least some sentence activities daily, orally and in writing, whether through the kinds of checks we just listed or through do-now activities, stop-and-jots, turn-and-talks, or homework. When students are ready to develop outlines, continue to include regular practice with sentences in your lessons. As students start converting their outlines into drafts, they will need to use what they've learned from the sentence activities as tools for revision.

**Breaking Down the Writing Process**

To make writing manageable for your students, break down the process into four basic steps—outlining, drafting, revising and editing, and final copy

—as shown here.

1. **Outlining** \*

2. **Drafting**

3. **Revising/editing** \*

4. **Final copy**

Most instructional time should be spent on Steps 1 and 3 (hence the red stars), outlining and revising and editing the draft. Lessons can end after Steps 1 or 3—but not after Step 2.

Always have your students revise and edit a draft, whether or not they go on to turn it into a final copy.

The outlining and revising/editing stages need to be broken down into a number of smaller components—first in the context of paragraphs, and later in the context of compositions.

Don't skip any of the scaffolding steps; just speed up your rate for more proficient students. Make sure that all students have had practice identifying and constructing topic sentences before you ask them to create one for an SPO.

It's important to provide your students with plenty of demonstrations and practice to get them to the point where they'll be able to craft varied sentences; outline and write cohesive, coherent paragraphs and compositions; and revise their writing effectively. You may be tempted to let your students just plunge into a piece of writing without going through all these steps. After all, don't experienced writers do that? The answer is that some do and many don't. Especially for more analytical and longer forms of writing—books, for example—many accomplished writers find outlining to be essential, and **all** professional writers take time to revise.

Beyond that, experienced, competent writers are able to juggle numerous factors simultaneously so that composing becomes a recursive process.

They may fine-tune their sentences as they go, replacing a word here and omitting a comma there. They may repeatedly shift the order of paragraphs and ideas. But these writers can draw on ample writing experience as well as deep knowledge of both written language and their topic. They may be equipped to draft, revise, and even plan their writing more or less simultaneously.

The great majority of the students we work with, however, lack both that kind of experience and that level of knowledge. They need to approach the task one step at a time, while continuing to practice previously learned strategies, in order to produce an effective piece of writing. As with sentence activities, even after your students have become experienced at creating outlines and revising drafts, it's important to keep practicing the scaffolding activities that helped them arrive at that point.

**Pacing the Strategies: Using Your Judgment**

Teachers often ask questions like: “How long should we keep teaching fragments?” “When can we start the Single-Paragraph Outline?” “Should I stay with sentence expansion until I think the students have mastered it?” “How do we know when to start writing introductions?”

We understand that teachers want clear guidelines about the pacing of the strategies and at what point they should move on to the next one. We wish we could provide them with straightforward answers, but writing instruction doesn't work like that. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. You will need to determine where your students are at the outset, what they need, and how fast they are able to move through the sequence of strategies. The beginning-of-the-year writing assessment we discussed in Chapter 11 will help you determine your instructional priorities and objectives, and later formative assessments will guide you to modify them.

When deciding how long to spend on any one TWR strategy or activity, you have to exercise your own judgment about your students' oral and written language abilities. Among the factors to consider are the following:

Performance on beginning- and middle-of-year assessments

The grade level at which they were introduced to TWR strategies

Their familiarity with the conventions of English grammar

Their sense of what they need to include, omit, or revise in their writing so that it's understandable to a reader In addition—as we noted previously—writing, more than any other task, taxes a student's working memory and executive functions. Remember that there's a limit to how many things we can hold in our working memory. If your students are still struggling with the mechanics of writing—

handwriting, spelling, usage, and so on—they won't have the space in working memory to simultaneously think about higher-level aspects such as purpose, meaning, audience, word choice, and syntax. Before they can address those considerations in depth and without guidance, their lower-level skills will need to have reached a point where the mechanics are not absorbing most of their attention.

**Sequence of Activities through the Grades**

**The sequence on the following pages assumes that students are being introduced to the Hochman Method in the given grade** **level(s). ** If that's not the case for your students, you'll need to adjust accordingly. However, don't assume that simply because students are in ninth or tenth grade, they already understand the concept of a sentence or how to plan and construct an effective paragraph. We know from our experience that many high school students have yet to acquire these skills.

**All students who are being introduced to the method for the first time, no matter their grade level, should begin with sentence-level strategies and activities and proceed through the sequence in order. **

**It is not necessary for students to demonstrate mastery of every sentence strategy before moving on. Once they have been** **introduced to a few basic strategies, they can learn how to develop simple Single-Paragraph Outlines. ** They can also use those strategies to convert the words and phrases they've written on their outlines into sentences in a paragraph.

**The sequence is recursive. ** The activities for each of the following grades incorporate those introduced in all previous grades. They should be a regular part of instruction for middle and high school students, including both those who are familiar with the strategies and those who are new to the method. Always remember that when they're embedded in the content of the curriculum, these activities not only teach writing, but also are a powerful method of teaching subject matter.

Although this book is primarily a resource for grades 3–12, we thought it would be helpful to include what a K–2 sequence would look like as a foundation for the grades that follow.

**Pacing Guides**

Pacing guides displaying the preceding activities in the context of an academic year can be found on the Book Resources website.

TWR pacing guides are meant to be fluid. Sometimes you'll quicken the pace and at other times you'll need to backtrack. Bear in mind that your pace will be determined by your students' skill level, not their grade level. If you're teaching at the middle or high school level, you may be able to proceed through the sequence of strategies more rapidly than a teacher whose students are in the early elementary grades. But that may not be the case if your students are still learning English, have language-based learning disabilities, or face other challenges.
