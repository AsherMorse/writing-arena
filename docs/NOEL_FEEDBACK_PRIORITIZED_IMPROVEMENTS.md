# Prioritized Improvements Based on Noel's Feedback

**Date:** December 2024  
**Priority:** Based on Learning Science Impact & Implementation Effort

---

## 🎯 Top 5 High-Impact Improvements

### 1. Explicit TWR Planning Phase ⭐⭐⭐

**Why:** Noel specifically mentioned "Plan using TWR (even a quick Because–But–So or thesis+2 supporting details)"

**Impact:** HIGH
- Reduces cognitive load during writing
- Explicit TWR scaffolding
- Improves organization
- Aligns with TWR methodology

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
- Add 30-60 second planning phase before writing
- Provide TWR planning tools (Because-But-So, SPO template)
- Show planning scaffold based on rank

---

### 2. Rank-Based Prompt Complexity System ⭐⭐⭐

**Why:** Noel explicitly recommended this: "Tier battle difficulty by rank... Time must scale up as complexity of compositions increase"

**Impact:** HIGH
- Completes Noel's recommendation
- Proper scaffolding progression
- Matches task complexity to skill level

**Effort:** Medium (3-4 days)

**Implementation:**
- Filter prompts by rank difficulty
- Bronze: Sentence-level prompts
- Silver: Paragraph prompts
- Gold: Micro-essay prompts
- Platinum+: AP-level FRQ prompts

---

### 3. Enhanced Feedback Literacy Training ⭐⭐

**Why:** Noel's concern: "Students cannot realistically read, understand, and evaluate... This risks low-quality feedback"

**Impact:** HIGH
- Improves feedback quality
- Teaches feedback literacy
- Better peer learning

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
- Show examples of good/bad feedback before Phase 2
- Real-time hints as students type
- Feedback rubric transparency

---

### 4. Explicit Revision Strategy Guidance ⭐⭐

**Why:** Noel: "Give students time to read feedback → Gain clarity around structuring feedback → Apply feedback meaningfully"

**Impact:** HIGH
- Students learn revision strategies
- More meaningful revisions
- Better application of feedback

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
- Step-by-step revision process
- Before/after examples
- Revision checklist
- Show what changed

---

### 5. Rank-Based UI Guidance ⭐⭐

**Why:** Noel: "UI must communicate tiered expectations"

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Clear expectations
- Reduces confusion
- Better alignment with rank

**Effort:** Low (1 day)

**Implementation:**
- Show rank-specific expectations
- Display task complexity
- Word count targets by rank
