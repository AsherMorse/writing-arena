## Noel's Recommendations vs. Implementation

### ✅ Recommendation 1: Increase Cycle to 10-15 Minutes

**Noel's Recommendation:** 10-13 minutes total  
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **12 minutes** (5/3/4 min)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - WITHIN RANGE**

### ✅ Recommendation 2: Reduce to 3 Peer Review Questions

**Noel's Recommendation:** 3 targeted questions  
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **3 questions** (mainIdea, strength, suggestion)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - EXACT MATCH**

### ✅ Recommendation 3: Tier Battle Difficulty by Rank

**Noel's Recommendation:** Rank-based timing + prompt complexity  
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **Rank-based timing COMPLETE**  
**Status:** ✅ **CORE COMPLETE** (Prompt complexity optional enhancement)
