### Notes

* Projects for joe presentation will be trued up today   
* QUALITY \> QUANTITY  
  * Get this shit out

* **If the grader is good then maybe we can easily change ranked matches to be**  
  * **Sentence → paragraph → essay**  
  *  **Hole-fill as needed**

### Todo

* Either work on gap identification or improvement  
  * Dont get blocked  
  * Need SOMETHING at the very least the flow  
* I want to do phase 5 first, so I know what I’m making looks like

* Figure out if youre going to rip or use your own shit  
* Finish full flow  
  * If it’s good THEN we can worry about adding additional lessons  
    * NEEDS to be rooted in learning science  
    * TEACH TO THE TEST  
  * Either rip alphawrite or make our own shit  
    * I think rip a minified version and adapt where possible  
* Figure out what we need to teach for each of sentence/paragraph/multi-paragraph  
* **~~Projects sheet (start at 7pm)~~**  
* Do paragraph shit  
* Watch scribble joe-presentation video  
* ~~Find out what issues there are with AlphaWrite~~

* Grab activities list from alphawrite repo  
* Look up who learning science team are  
  * [https://x.com/c\_hendrick/status/1995351173680021573?s=46\&t=PXjpXuLEdTnWaoTa3F\_FMQ](https://x.com/c_hendrick/status/1995351173680021573?s=46&t=PXjpXuLEdTnWaoTa3F_FMQ) 

### Schedule

* .

### Schedule rough

* Figure out what hole-filling section needs to look like  
  * Are you yanking from alphawrite  
  * making your own shit (just have the kids respond to fucking prompts)  
  * What do we need to hole-fill on?

### Project

* Goals

### Todo

* Add essay grader in addition to paragraph grader  
- [x] ~~Apply learning science team~~  
      * [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTbYP--mWV6U5ov82qsBobrqK8rSobyZMvzRdiEpPldSrVXQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTbYP--mWV6U5ov82qsBobrqK8rSobyZMvzRdiEpPldSrVXQ/viewform)    
- [x] ~~Send andy email~~  
      * Go through one flow  
      * One rank

### Notes

* Is this shit even from the alphawrite repo?  
  * Wtf is immediate gap detection for?  
  * → maybe we just try to catch it immediately?  
* Dude this is too detailed  
  * Just hit the categories, do historical analysis, run them through the necessary lessons → immediately if it’s bad enough

* What rubric are we judging them on – what kinds of hole-filling should we do  
  * Just map directly to TWR (see checklist)? Or maybe we should look at the educational outcomes  
    * AP Lang exam rubric (4/4 evidence and commentary)  
      * Synthesis  
        * EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning.   
      * Rhetorical analysis  
        * Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning.   
      * Argument   
        * EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning.  
      * If they pass TWR do they pass this? I’m not sure  
    * Alpha Writing G8.4  
      * ![][image1]  
      * If they meet TWR they meet this for sure – this is not anything out of the ordinary  
* ![][image2]

### Unsent prompts

* okay lets work on the gap detection outside of this and then fix the match flow later? idk like let's figure out the grader I think  
* so let's look at activities we have (including partial/limited) in @alphawrite-integration-analysis.md and also the checklists from @writing-assessment-checklists.md  
* idea here is to figure out what the grader is looking for  
* 

* okay yeah lets modify to use cardinal-rubric, let's get minimum paragraph count in, used credible and relevant evidence, also "chose appropriate audience and addressed prompt/topic"  
* rest is okay I think, we're merging the code in anyways right?  
* 


### Schedule

- [ ] Finish cleaning up basic improve section  
- [ ] Do gap finding  
- [ ] Add in necessary lessons  
- [ ] Align with educational outcomes  
      * Get rubric and flow right  
- [ ] Tiers? Just means changing prompts and timings  
- [ ] UI fix  
- [ ]

### Pomodoro

* 17

The Goal: *"It looks awesome AND it's academically effective \- either the same or better than what they could spend their time on."*

* Just work on main and then merge after?  
  * Or make fixes in parallel?

### Todo

* Still need to add all the lessons  
* Need to implement new grader   
* Should be getting feedback any way we can

* Grader → feedback → lesson flow  
  * Integrate grader with results page  
    * Store grader results  
  * Immediate block on a severe issue  
    * Need to figure out blocking  
  * Block after 3 matches of accumulated issue  
    * Accumulated how?  
  * Force student to go through lessons  
  * THEN allowed back in  
* Focus on paragraph mode right now  
  * Make it a fun GAME

### Notes

* Stick to ranked testing, this is core game mechanic  
* Used essay-paragraph-grader…[v2.md](http://v2.md) to get the graders,  
  * Questions  
    * Did we get everything on offer? Are there additional fields that we need that we could be using  
  * Notes  
    * Main thing we need is to map to specific weaknesses that we can hole-fill with lessons/activities  
      * If you get a “no” on anything then it’s an immediate required hole-filling  
      *   
    * What we didn’t take  
      * Text highlighting  
    * Mapping is off  
      * Used credible \+ relevant evidence maps to “transition-words” and “kernel-expansion”  
        * ![][image1]  
    * ![][image2]  
      * Category scoring looks useful but we would need to keep track  
        * More important is   
          * You’re writing sucks in this way

  * Fast cuts, show how it works  
  * Email sign up list  
  * WAGMI


* Can ask Skinner on tips  
  * Excalidraw or workflowy  
  * Intrinsic motivation but supports learning outcomes

* Get this ready for Andy demo monday

### Notes

* How was I doing the elaborate paragraph activity before?  
* Why medieval theme?   
* There is nothing transformative here  
  * This is just a shitty alphawrite  
* How does this map to ap lang essay outcomes???

* Grader is basically the most important thing no?  
  * If you can identify gaps correctly then you can prescribe lessons correctly. If you can prescribe lessons/path then you can fix the problem  
  * Idk bruh

* Are you going to run this intensive grader on all 5 responses? – well they should all be done around the same time, it is completed async right?  
  * Need to switch to a faster model

* Why isn’t this a shitty alphawrite  
  * We focus on writing activities, fine-tuned grader  
  * Maybe fine-tuned for ap lang

* Revision phase  
  * Use alphawrite grader?

# 12-6-25
### Pomodoro

* 5  
* Review lessons/activities added

### Todo

* How’d you set up grader?

# 12-7-25
### Pomodoro

* 11

    * Maybe need to run it locally

* Establish visual style for rest of website

* Actually figure out how you’re going to teach kids. What makes you better than alphawrite  
  * Story mode like ai dungeon?

* Hole-filling and mapping to lessons

* Switch to o3 mini

### Notes

* Test out full flow on lessons  
  * Can do this shit later?  
  * Also need to add the waiting  
  * → some shit still cooked, just run through a bunch of them every now and then, iron out bugs  
  * → probably need “inspiration” section

- [x] ~~Import 33-write-freeform-paragraph~~

* What’s really to do  
  - [ ] Finish up core flow  
  - [ ] Finish up lessons  
  - [ ] Gamification to encourage writing  
        * Leaderboards

* Andy pitch  
  * WEWILLWRITE and use AlphaWrite for learning science

* If core loop is good we can wrap around gamification in a compelling enough way
