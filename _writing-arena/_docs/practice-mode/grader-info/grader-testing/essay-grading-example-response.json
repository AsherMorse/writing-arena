    "overallFeedback": "This essay demonstrates strong organizational structure with clear topic sentences, effective transitions, and proper acknowledgment of a counterclaim. To reach full proficiency for Grade 9 argumentative writing, focus on three priorities: (1) incorporating specific credible evidence (statistics, research data, expert quotations) rather than general observations, (2) developing fuller body paragraphs with at least 3 supporting detail sentences each, and (3) adding explicit reasoning that bridges evidence to claims by explaining WHY and HOW the evidence proves your point."
