# 02-fragment-or-sentence

## Goal

Help students understand what makes a complete sentence and develop their ability to fix sentence fragments.

### Secondary Goals

- Practice correct capitalization and punctuation
- Reinforce understanding of subjects and predicates without using technical terms
- Build comprehension through content-embedded practice
- Develop proofreading and editing skills

## How It Works

Students are given one or more sentence fragments, and their task is to expand them into complete sentences.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Avoid technical terms like subject and predicate. Instead, guide students by asking "who" or "what" did something. Use familiar content and common knowledge.

### Level 2

Can introduce terms like subject and predicate. Can work with more complex fragments including prepositional phrases and dependent clauses.

## Important Principles for Grading

- The expanded sentence must include the original fragment
- The expanded sentence must express a logical thought

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Incomplete expansions

When expanding fragments, students might add words without creating a complete thought

**Example:** Fragment: "in the park" → "Walking in the park" (still missing who is walking)



## Format Requirements

### The expanded sentence must include the original fragment

**Correct Example:** Fragment: "to the store" → "My mom drove to the store."

**Incorrect Example:** Fragment: "to the store" → "I went shopping."



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Fragment: "in the garden" → "The flowers in the garden are blooming.""

The student created a complete sentence by adding both a subject (flowers) and a verb (are blooming), while maintaining the original fragment.

### Example: "Fragment: "under the table" → "the cat hid under the table.""

Although the first word is not capitalized, this is considered a minor issue (a "nit") and the answer is still correct because it successfully creates a complete sentence with a subject (cat) and verb (hid) while including the original fragment.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Classification: "The big brown dog." incorrectly marked as a complete sentence"

Student missed that there is no action - what did the dog do?

### Example: "Fragment: "to the store" → "Went to the store""

Still missing a subject - who or what went to the store?



---

# 04-unscramble-sentences

## Goal

Help students develop sentence construction skills by unscrambling jumbled words into coherent, grammatically correct sentences.

### Secondary Goals

- Improve knowledge of sentence structure (subject, verb, object)
- Build vocabulary and enhance reading fluency
- Foster attention to detail when arranging words and phrases

## How It Works

In this activity, students are given a set of words or short phrases that are out of order.
They must rearrange (unscramble) these words to form a properly structured sentence. For example, unscrambling "the school bus took James to" might become "James took the bus to school."
The student can only use the words from the scrambled prompt.
The student is welcome to use the words in any order they choose – as long as the result is coherent and meets the other requirements, it is correct.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Sentences will be shorter, and there may be the occasional error like a forgotten apostrophe.  If a student forgets a word, then that is an error.

### Level 2

Be a bit stricter on grammatical errors like sentence verb agreement.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Word Order:
- Ensure the unscrambled sentence has a logical subject-verb-object arrangement.

2. Coherent Meaning:
- The unscrambled words must form a complete, sensible thought without missing key elements.
- Importantly, the student's submission DOES NOT need to have the exact same meaning as the original;
- If the student creates a sentence with a different meaning but is *still coherent* and meets the other requirements, consider this to be correct.

3. Grammar & Agreement:
- Check for subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent alignment, and correct use of modifiers where applicable.

4. Diacritics and apostrophes:
- If the student's answer misses or incorrectly forgets/includes diacritics or apostrophes, that is a nit, and it is not an error. PLEASE DO NOT MARK THIS AS AN ERROR.
5. Spelling:
- If the student's misses spelling a letter of a word, that is an **error**.
6. Remember, the student can only use the words from the scrambled prompt.
    - Please do not suggest words that are not in the scrambled prompt.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Misplacing key words or phrases, resulting in incoherent sentences

Students may scramble the subject and verb or place adjectives in a way that disrupts the sentence flow.

**Example:** Scrambled: "cookies chocolate ate I delicious" submitted as "Ate I cookies delicious chocolate."

### Leaving out words entirely

Sometimes students miss a word when reordering, leading to an incomplete sentence.

**Example:** Scrambled: "the runner swiftly finished race the" → "The runner swiftly finished the." (missing "race")



## Format Requirements

### The unscrambled sentence must use every word from the scrambled prompt

**Correct Example:** Scrambled: "went yesterday the store she to" → "She went to the store yesterday."

**Incorrect Example:** Scrambled: "went yesterday the store she to" → "She went to the store." (omitted "yesterday")



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Scrambled: "to library the walked I quietly" → "I walked quietly to the library.""

The student correctly used all words in a coherent order, started with a capital letter, and ended with a period.

### Example: "Scrambled: "arrived bus the late morning in" → "The bus arrived late in the morning.""

All words from the scrambled prompt are included, the sentence reads smoothly, and the necessary punctuation is present.

### Example: "Scrambled: "found señor the keys lost his" → "The senor found his lost keys.""

Even though the 'ñ' in 'señor' is missing, the sentence's structure and punctuation are correct. Missing diacritics are treated as a nit, not an error.

### Example: "Scrambled: "the revolves sun earth the around" → "The earth revolves around the sun.""

The student should have capitalized "Earth" when referring to the planet, but this is only "nit", not an error. The sentence is otherwise correct.

### Example: "Scrambled: "quickly ran dog the across yard the" → "the dog quickly ran across the yard.""

The sentence has correct word order and includes all words, but the first word is not capitalized. This is considered a minor issue (a nit) rather than an error that would make the answer incorrect.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Scrambled: "roared lion the inside cage the" → "The lion inside cage roared the.""

Although each word is present, the order is incorrect, leading to an awkward sentence structure.

# 05-identify-sentence-type

## Goal

Help students accurately identify the four main sentence types: Declarative, Interrogative, Exclamatory, and Imperative.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce punctuation rules associated with each sentence type
- Practice reading comprehension and syntax awareness
- Recognize that Imperative sentences can end in an exclamation mark and still be considered Imperative or Exclamatory
- Build confidence in sentence-level grammar analysis

## How It Works

Students are given a sentence and must choose which type it represents:
• **Declarative**: A statement that ends with a period (".")
• **Interrogative**: A question that ends with a question mark ("?")
• **Exclamatory**: A sentence conveying strong emotion and ending with an exclamation mark ("!")
• **Imperative**: A command or request (often with an implied "you" as the subject) that can end with a period or an exclamation mark.

They submit their classification, and immediate feedback indicates whether they identified the correct type. If incorrect, the feedback clarifies which sentence features they missed.

**Important Note**: An imperative sentence that ends in an exclamation mark can be categorized as either Exclamatory or Imperative. Students will be credited as correct for identifying either classification.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Students might not know all the vocabulary around Interrogative, Exclamatory, Imperative, and Declarative, so make sure your feedback is clear and uses examples.

### Level 2

Students might not know all the vocabulary around Interrogative, Exclamatory, Imperative, and Declarative, so make sure your feedback is clear and uses examples.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Punctuation and Function:
- Check if the sentence ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.
- Consider the sentence’s function: does it make a statement, ask a question, issue a command, or express strong emotion?

2. Acceptable Overlaps:
- Remember that an imperative (command) ending with "!" can be categorized as either imperative or exclamatory.

3. Only focus on identifying the sentence type:
- The students are provided with the sentence, and can only choose one of the four sentence types. So if there are grammar issues or spelling issues or anything like that in the sentence, it is not relevant to the activity. Only focus on identifying the sentence type.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Misidentifying a question as declarative or exclamatory

Students may overlook the question mark or interpret the sentence as an expression of excitement rather than a query.

**Example:** Sentence: "Where are you going?" incorrectly labeled as Exclamatory.

### Confusing imperative with exclamatory

Some commands end with an exclamation mark and could be mistaken solely for exclamatory. Either classification can be correct, but students must realize it is still a command.

**Example:** Sentence: "Stop talking now!" labeled as Exclamatory, which is acceptable, but Imperative is also valid.

### Forgetting that declarative sentences can sometimes show emotion

A student might incorrectly mark a declarative sentence with strong emotion words as exclamatory if it ends in a period.

**Example:** Sentence: "I absolutely love this cake." incorrectly labeled as Exclamatory.



## Format Requirements

### Students must select one of the four sentence types correctly based on punctuation and the function of the sentence.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "Did you do your homework?" → Interrogative (ends in "?", asking a question).

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "Did you do your homework?" → Declarative (incorrectly ignoring the question mark).

### An imperative that ends in an exclamation mark can be counted as Imperative or Exclamatory.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "Finish your dinner!" → Accept either Imperative or Exclamatory as correct.

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "Finish your dinner!" → Marking it as Declarative or Interrogative is incorrect.



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "Please hand me the wrench." → Identified as Imperative"

Student notes the command form ("Please hand me..."), even though it ends with a period.

### Example: "Sentence: "What time is the movie?" → Identified as Interrogative"

A straightforward question ending with a question mark, correctly labeled.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "I can’t believe we’re going to Disney World!" → Identified as Imperative"

This sentence expresses excitement and is not issuing a command, so it should be labeled Exclamatory, not Imperative.

### Example: "Sentence: "Be careful on the icy road!" → Identified as Declarative"

This is clearly an imperative command with an exclamation. It should be Imperative or Exclamatory, but not Declarative.



---

# 06-change-sentence-type

## Goal

Help students practice converting a sentence from one type to another (Declarative, Interrogative, Exclamatory, Imperative).

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce punctuation rules when rewriting sentences
- Emphasize that imperatives can sometimes overlap with exclamatory sentences if they end with an exclamation mark
- Build deeper understanding of sentence function (statement vs. question vs. command vs. strong emotion)
- Promote attention to detail and grammatical correctness while allowing minor errors ("nits") to be noted but not heavily penalized

## How It Works

1. Students are given an original sentence along with an instruction to change it to a specific type (e.g., "Turn this declarative sentence into an interrogative sentence").
2. They rewrite the sentence while staying on the same topic of the sentence, so that it correctly matches the requested type, focusing on function and punctuation.
3. Major errors—such as failing to produce the requested sentence type or creating a severely ungrammatical sentence—are marked incorrect. Individual minor mistakes in spelling or punctuation (e.g., missing apostrophes) can be noted as nits. Multiple minor mistakes should be marked as errors.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Use shorter, straightforward sentences. Provide clear transformations (e.g., "I like pizza." → "Do I like pizza?"). Tolerate minor punctuation lapses but reinforce ending marks.

### Level 2

Include more complex sentences that require deeper syntactic adjustments (e.g., adding question words or reordering phrases). Encourage accuracy in grammar, but minor typographical errors are not the main focus.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Use the correct sentence type:
- The transformed sentence MUST clearly function as the intended sentence type.
- If the intended sentence type is Declarative, the sentence MUST end with a period to be marked as correct.
- If the intended sentence type is Interrogative, the sentence MUST end with a question mark to be marked as correct.
- If the intended sentence type is Imperative, the sentence MUST be structured as a command or instruction (often beginning with a verb) and can end with either a period or an exclamation mark.
- If the intended sentence type is Exclamatory, the sentence MUST end with an exclamation mark AND express strong emotion or emphasis. Not all sentences with exclamation marks are exclamatory sentences - an imperative command with an exclamation mark remains an imperative sentence.

2. Stays on topic:
- The transformed sentence should retain at least the the core idea of the original or adapt it logically when converting types. If it's still on topic, it's still correct.
- However, give a nit if the changes the meaning a tiny bit, but is still on topic.

3. Handling Minor Errors ("nits"):
- Errors like missing apostrophes or minor pluralization mistakes are noted but do not overshadow correct identification and transformation of the sentence type.

4. Acceptable Overlaps:
- Distinguish carefully between imperative sentences with exclamation marks and true exclamatory sentences:
  * "Look at that!" is an imperative sentence with an exclamation mark (it gives a command)
  * "How beautiful that is!" is a true exclamatory sentence (it expresses emotion/emphasis)
  * When in doubt, examine the sentence structure: exclamatory sentences often begin with "what" or "how" and focus on expressing emotion, while imperatives give commands/instructions.

5. The student should write a single sentence.


## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Using the wrong punctuation for the requested type

Students must use the required punctuation for the requested sentence type. Declarative sentences must end with a period. Interrogative sentences must end with a question mark. Imperative sentences can end with a period or an exclamation mark. Exclamatory sentences must end with an exclamation mark.

**Example:** Original: "It is cold outside." → Asked for Interrogative → "Is it cold outside." (missing question mark)

### Accidentally maintaining the same sentence type

Students might rephrase the sentence but keep it as a statement when asked for a question, or vice versa.

**Example:** Original: "I enjoy reading books." → Asked for Imperative → "I enjoy reading books!" (still not a command)

### Major grammar errors

Sometimes, in the rush to change punctuation or sentence structure, students lose coherence or introduce major grammar errors.

**Example:** Original: "Take out the trash." → Asked for Interrogative → "Do take out trash the?" (word order is severely incorrect)

### Incorrectly mixing together two different sentence types

Students may write mix two different sentence types into the same sentence. The sentence should use only the sentence type requested.

**Example:** Mixing interrogative and exclamatory: "Isn't it beautiful!"; mixing imperative and interrogative: "Tell me why you did that?"; Exception: Mixing imperative and exclamatory: "Go to your room!" (consider this correct)

### Confusing sentences with exclamation marks with exclamatory sentences

Not all sentences ending with an exclamation mark are exclamatory sentences. Imperative sentences (commands) with exclamation marks are still imperative sentences, while true exclamatory sentences express strong emotion or emphasis.

**Example:** Imperative with exclamation: "Look at that bird!" vs. Exclamatory: "What a beautiful bird that is!"



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Original: "You have to eat your vegetables." → Asked for Interrogative: "Do you have to eat your vegetables?""

The student added a helping verb and changed punctuation to form a question, preserving the meaning.

### Example: "Original: "We will pass the test." → Asked for Exclamatory: "We will pass the test!""

The student kept the statement's content but changed the punctuation and tone to express excitement.

### Example: "Original: "The dog runs fast." → Asked for Exclamatory: "Look how fast that dog can run!""

While the student rephrased the sentence structure, they maintained the core meaning about the dog's speed while successfully transforming it to an exclamatory sentence.

### Example: "Original: "The cake tastes delicious." → Asked for Exclamatory: "What a delicious cake this is!""

This is correct. The student transformed a declarative statement into a proper exclamatory sentence that expresses amazement about the cake's taste.

### Example: "Original: "Close the door and keep the heat in." → Asked for Exclamatory: "How wonderfully warm it is in here!""

This is correct. The student successfully transformed the imperative command into an exclamatory sentence that expresses excitement about the warmth, while maintaining the core meaning about keeping the heat inside.

### Example: "Original: "Do you want to go to the park?" → Asked for Declarative: "I want to go to the park.""

This is correct. Although the student changed the subject from "you" to "I", they successfully transformed the interrogative question into a declarative statement. Small changes in meaning are acceptable as long as the core topic remains and the sentence type is correctly transformed.

### Example: "Original: "The cat sleeps on the windowsill." → Asked for Interrogative: "Why does the cat always choose the windowsill for naps?""

This is correct. While the specific meaning has shifted from a simple statement of fact to questioning the behavior, the core topic (the cat and windowsill) remains the same. The sentence is properly transformed into an interrogative question.

### Example: "Original: "What time does the movie start?" → Asked for Declarative: "The movie starts at 7:00.""

This is correct. While the declarative statement provides specific information not present in the original question, it maintains the core topic (movie start time) and successfully transforms from interrogative to declarative form.

### Example: "Original: "Look at the stars." → Asked for Exclamatory: "How brightly the stars shine tonight!""

This is correct. The student transformed an imperative command into a proper exclamatory sentence that expresses wonder or amazement about the stars, rather than just adding an exclamation mark to the original command.

### Example: "Original: "What a beautiful day it is!" → Asked for Imperative: "Enjoy this beautiful day!""

This is correct. The student transformed a true exclamatory sentence into an imperative command, maintaining the topic while changing the sentence type.

### Example: "Original: "The sun is shining today." → Asked for Interrogative: "is the sun shining today?""

This is correct. The student successfully transformed the declarative statement into an interrogative question. The first word not being capitalized is just a minor issue (a "nit"), not an error that affects the sentence type transformation.

### Example: "Original: "The movie was excellent." → Asked for Interrogative: "Was the movie excellent""

This is correct. The student successfully transformed the declarative statement into an interrogative question by inverting the subject and verb. The missing question mark at the end is just a minor issue (a "nit"), not an error that affects the sentence type transformation.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Original: "Please turn off the lights." → Asked for Interrogative: "You turn off the lights?""

This is an error. Although the punctuation is now a question mark, the sentence lacks a proper question structure (it should be something like "Will you turn off the lights?").

### Example: "Original: "Is the dog barking outside?" → Asked for Declarative: "The dog barking outside.""

This is an error. The new version is missing a verb ("The dog is barking outside.") and does not properly form a declarative sentence.

### Example: "Original: "Have you seen the sunset?" → Asked for Exclamatory: "Have you seen how beautiful the sunset is!""

This is an error. This response combines interrogative and exclamatory forms, creating a hybrid sentence that does not properly transform into a pure exclamatory sentence. A correct version would be "How magnificent the sunset is!"

### Example: "Original: "I love dogs." → Asked for Exclamatory: "I love dogs!!!""

This is an error. For formal writing, use a single exclamation mark to express excitement. The student used three exclamation marks, which is excessive.

### Example: "Original: "Close the door." → Asked for Exclamatory: "Close the door!""

This is an error. Simply adding an exclamation mark to an imperative sentence does not make it exclamatory. It remains an imperative sentence (a command) with emphasis. A true exclamatory transformation would be something like "How drafty it is with the door open!"

# 07-write-sentence-type

## Goal

Have students craft a brand-new sentence that uses a specific vocabulary word and matches a requested sentence type.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce correct usage of each of the four main sentence types
- Encourage proper punctuation and grammar when constructing sentences
- Highlight that Imperative sentences can end with a period or exclamation mark
- Accept minor “nit” errors (e.g., missing apostrophes) but focus on correctness of sentence type and inclusion of the vocab word

## How It Works

1. Students receive a vocabulary word (e.g., "enormous") and a target sentence type (Declarative, Interrogative, Exclamatory, or Imperative).
2. They must write a single sentence that includes the vocabulary word and demonstrates the requested sentence type.
3. Major errors (e.g., failing to use the vocab word, severely ungrammatical sentences) are marked incorrect. Minor errors in spelling or spacing are noted but do not overshadow the main goal.
4. Feedback centers on whether they used the word correctly, adhered to the sentence type, and formed a coherent sentence.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Prompt short, straightforward sentences using the vocabulary word in a familiar context. Monitor basic subject-verb agreement and punctuation.

### Level 2

Allow for more complex sentences, possibly with modifiers or clauses. Emphasize correct usage of punctuation and clarity in advanced sentence structures.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Correct Sentence Type:
- Declarative must end with a period and express a statement.
- Interrogative must end with a question mark and pose a question.
- Exclamatory should convey strong emotion and typically end with an exclamation mark.
- Imperative is a command/request and can end with a period or an exclamation mark. The implied subject is usually “you.”

2. Inclusion of the Vocabulary Word:
- The sentence must meaningfully incorporate the assigned vocab word; omitting or misusing it is a critical error.

3. Coherence and Basic Grammar:
- The sentence should be logical, have correct word order, and be relatively free of egregious grammatical mistakes.
- Minor errors ("nits") like missing apostrophes or minor spelling slips do not invalidate a correct sentence type and vocab usage.

4. Single-Sentence Requirement:
- Students should provide exactly one sentence. If they write multiple or fragmentary pieces, prompt them to revise.

5. Acceptable Overlaps (Imperative vs. Exclamatory):
- An imperative sentence ending with "!" may appear exclamatory, but as long as it functions primarily as a command, it should be accepted as imperative (and vice versa if the instructions permit).

6. Do an explicit check to make sure the student included the right ending punctuation.
- If the ending punctuation is missing/wrong, mark it as a "nit"

7. Forms of the word are acceptable and considered correct usage.
- If a student uses a form of the word that is not the base form, thats ok and it can still be correct.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Forgetting to include the assigned vocabulary word

Students may focus on sentence type but omit the vocab word entirely.

**Example:** Assigned word: "enormous" → Sentence: "Please check the door." (No use of “enormous”.)

### Incorrect punctuation for the requested type

A question that ends in a period or a statement that ends in an exclamation mark is mismatched.

**Example:** Required Interrogative: "Is the house enormous." (missing the question mark) – this is a "nit", not an error!

### Overly fragmentary or run-on sentences

Students may create an incomplete thought or cram multiple ideas without proper structure.

**Example:** Sentence: "Enormous the dog running all day." (fragmentary, lacks clear verb structure).



## Format Requirements

### Use the provided vocabulary word in a single sentence matching the requested type.

**Correct Example:** Vocabulary: "enormous", Type: Declarative → "That enormous tree shades our entire backyard."

**Incorrect Example:** Vocabulary: "enormous", Type: Declarative → "What is that enormous tree?" (Interrogative, not Declarative)

### Minor errors are noted but do not overshadow correct sentence type and vocab usage.

**Correct Example:** Vocabulary: "dazzling", Type: Exclamatory → "That dazzling display of fireworks is incredible!"

**Incorrect Example:** Vocabulary: "dazzling", Type: Exclamatory → "I see a dazzling display of fireworks." (period at the end, so it’s not exclamatory)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Vocabulary: "enormous", Type: Interrogative → "Is that enormous statue taller than the tree behind it?""

The student has used the vocab word meaningfully in a properly punctuated question.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "dazzling", Type: Exclamatory → "What a dazzling performance you gave!""

Conveys strong emotion and ends with an exclamation point, fulfilling the exclamatory requirement.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "politely", Type: Imperative → "Politely offer your seat to an elderly person!""

Correctly uses the adverb “politely” and issues a command with an exclamation mark, acceptable for an imperative sentence.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "quietly", Type: Declarative → "He quietly slipped out of the room.""

This is a straightforward statement (declarative) ending with a period, correctly incorporating the vocab word.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "dance", Type: Declarative → "The children danced in the park.""

Uses the base form of "dance" correctly in a simple declarative statement that describes an action. Forms of the word "dance" are acceptable and considered correct usage.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "delicious", Type: Exclamatory → "This cake is absolutely delicious!""

Uses strong emotion and proper exclamatory punctuation while incorporating the vocabulary word meaningfully.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "wonderful", Type: Exclamatory → "This is incredible wonderful!""

Uses strong emotion and proper exclamatory punctuation while incorporating the vocabulary word meaningfully.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Vocabulary: "enormous", Type: Interrogative → "That enormous mountain is breathtaking.""

Though the vocab word is used, it’s a statement (declarative), not a question (interrogative).

### Example: "Vocabulary: "dazzling", Type: Exclamatory → "The dazzling show.""

Fragment – lacks a verb or complete thought, and thus doesn’t fulfill the sentence requirement.

### Example: "Vocabulary: "quietly", Type: Imperative → "Quietly that cat purring.""

Doesn’t form a logical command; the structure is jumbled, making it unclear and not truly imperative.

# 08-write-sentence-about-picture

## Goal

Have students write clear, descriptive questions based on details from a given picture.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce complete-sentence writing (subject + verb + clear idea)
- Encourage attention to specific details and logical observations
- Foster visual literacy by making inferences about what's happening in the image
- Discourage and penalize generic questions like "What is this?" or "What is that?"

## How It Works

Students are presented with an image and asked to write a specified number of sentences describing what they see or inferring what might be happening.
All questions must be complete, relevant, and based on the actual scene in the picture.
Questions in the form of genuine, specific questions (e.g., "Why is the ox pulling the cart?") are acceptable, but generic questions (e.g., "What is this?") are not.
Immediate feedback highlights any incomplete sentences, off-topic content, or generic questions that lack descriptive detail.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Encourage basic descriptive questions about visible objects and straightforward actions.

### Level 2

Prompt more thoughtful or inference-based statements, such as guesses about the characters' motivations or the setting's historical context.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Completeness and Accuracy:
- Each sentence should accurately reflect something from the image. However, minor grammar errors like a misspelling or missing apostrophe are nits, not errors.

2. Specificity over Generic Questions:
- Sentences that merely ask "What is this?" or "What's that?" should be graded as incorrect.

3. Descriptive Detail & Inference:
- Students can describe colors, actions, setting, or make reasonable guesses about context (e.g., "They are preparing the cart for market.").

4. Cohesion and Relevance:
- Ensure the questions connect logically to the image. Completely unrelated or random statements should be flagged.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Writing incomplete or fragmentary questions

Students may write partial questions missing key components (e.g., "Why the cart?" instead of "Why is the cart so full?")

**Example:** Fragment: "Where the ox?" (lacks proper verb and complete question structure).

### Asking vague or generic questions

Questions like "What is that?" or "What are they doing?" give minimal detail and don't demonstrate thoughtful observation.

**Example:** Question: "What is this?" (doesn't show observation or inference; should be marked incorrect).

### Asking questions about things not visible in the picture

Sometimes students ask questions about imagined details or elements that aren't actually shown in the image.

**Example:** Question: "Why is the spaceship landing behind the barn?" when there is only a barn and an ox in the scene.

### Not writing a question

Students may write a declarative statement when they were specifically asked to write a question about the image. The student's response must include at least one complete question.

**Example:** Statement: "The farmer is working in the field." when asked to write a question about what they see.



## Format Requirements

### The response must include at least one complete question that focuses on specific details in the image.

**Correct Example:** Question: "What is the farmer doing? Is he going to drive that tractor?" (multiple questions)
Question: "What day of the week is it? It looks like a Monday." (a question followed by a statement)

**Incorrect Example:** Question: "That is interesting." (this isn't a question)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Question: "Why is the ox pulling such a heavily loaded cart through the muddy field?""

Student asks a specific question that references multiple details visible in the image.

### Example: "Question: "How does the farmer manage to control such a large ox while also balancing the overflowing cart?""

Shows careful observation of the scene and asks about the relationship between visible elements.

### Example: "Question: "How many oxen are pulling the cart?""

A straightforward but valid question that focuses on a clear, countable detail in the image.

### Example: "Question: "What color is the barn in the background?""

A simple but specific question that references an actual element visible in the scene.

### Example: "Question: "What is the farmer doing?""

A question that focuses on the action or activity of the farmer, referencing a visible detail in the image.

### Example: "Question: "Is this kitchen table made from marble?""

A specific question about a visible material detail that shows careful observation of the furniture.

### Example: "Question: "Where is this backyard located?""

A specific question about a visible location detail that shows careful observation of the scene.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Question: "What are those?""

This generic question lacks any specific details from the image and shows minimal engagement.

### Example: "Question: "Is that the ocean?" (when the image is clearly of the ocean)"

This generic question lacks any specific details from the image and shows minimal engagement. A better example would be: "Is that the Atlantic ocean?" or "Why aren't there any waves in the ocean?" or "Is it high tide right now?"

### Example: "Question: "The cart looks heavy.""

This is a statement rather than a question, and fails to meet the basic requirement of the task.

### Example: "Question: "Where is that from?""

This question is too generic and lacks specific details about the image.

### Example: "Question: "How many dogs does she have, is it three?""

This attempts to combine two separate questions in one sentence.

# 09-expository-writing-terms

## Goal

Help students understand and effectively use expository terms to formulate clear, focused questions and directions about academic content.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop understanding of different expository terms and their purposes
- Practice formulating clear, focused questions and directions
- Learn to write appropriate responses to expository directions
- Encourage close reading and analysis of content material
- Build content knowledge through structured writing practice

## How It Works

This activity follows a structured process:
1. Students are given a topic and one or more expository terms (e.g., "compare", "describe", "explain")
2. For each term, they must write a clear direction using that term (e.g., "Compare frogs and toads.")
3. For Level 2 students, they must also write an appropriate response to their direction

The student must:
- Use the expository term correctly in context
- Create a clear, focused direction about the given topic
- (For Level 2 only) Write an appropriate response that fully addresses their direction

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

The writing direction submitted by the student can be quite simple.
As long as the student uses the expository term in a believable way, consider it correct.
Don't stress pedantics over the specific wording of the direction.
Focus on the proper use of expository terms rather than factual accuracy.
Accept any reasonable content that shows understanding of how to use the term.
Be flexible with multiple expository terms if they are related to the same topic and the required term is used correctly.
However, the writing direction MUST address the assigned topic/subtopic - this is not flexible.
Students do NOT need to write about the same specific animals or subjects as the example - they only need to address the general topic/subtopic.

### Level 2

Expect clear, direct responses that answer the direction.
A single, well-written sentence can be a perfectly valid response.
Focus on accuracy and clarity rather than length or complexity.
The response must demonstrate basic understanding of the topic.
Do not evaluate factual or scientific accuracy - focus on proper use of expository terms.
Accept related additional expository terms that enhance the direction without changing its primary focus.
Regardless of grade level, every writing direction must address the assigned topic/subtopic, not a different subject area.
Students have flexibility to explore any specific aspects or examples within the topic/subtopic - they do NOT need to match the specific examples shown.
For Level 2, responses should:
- Answer the direction directly
- Be clear and accurate in using the expository term
- Stay on topic
- Use appropriate academic language
- Be grammatically complete

## Important Principles for Grading

The writing direction must begin with or prominently feature the given expository term
The writing direction must be clearly focused on the given topic
The writing direction must address the specific subtopic provided, not just the general topic
The example direction is ONLY a model for format - students are NOT required to address the same specific subject as the example
For example, if the subtopic is "mammals" and the example discusses wolves, a student writing about lions or elephants is perfectly valid
The writing direction must be grammatically complete and correct
The writing direction must demonstrate understanding of how to use the expository term
The writing direction should be original and not copied directly from the example
While the example serves as a model, students should create their own unique directions that show independent thinking
For Level 2 responses, prioritize clarity and accuracy over length or complexity
Do NOT evaluate the factual or scientific accuracy of the content - focus only on the correct usage of expository terms and clear writing
Accept any reasonable response that demonstrates proper use of the expository term, even if the content contains minor factual inaccuracies
Additional expository terms may be included in the writing direction as long as the required term is used correctly and prominently
When in doubt about ambiguous cases (like using multiple expository terms), favor giving the student credit if the required term is used appropriately
Even with correct use of the expository term, a writing direction about a completely different topic should be marked incorrect

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Copying the example direction

Students might copy the example direction with only minor changes

**Example:** If example is "Compare frogs and toads", student writes "Compare toads and frogs"

### Off-topic responses

Response might be well-written but not directly answer the direction

**Example:** Direction: "Explain why absolute rulers were powerful" → Response about modern democracy instead

### Grader incorrectly expecting same specific subject as example

This is a GRADER MISTAKE, not a student mistake. The grader might incorrectly expect students to write about the exact same specific animals or subjects covered in the example direction

**Example:** Topic: Animals, Subtopic: Mammals. Example: "Discuss wolf packs". Student: "Discuss the hunting techniques of lions." This is CORRECT as lions are mammals.

### Off-topic writing directions

Writing direction might use the correct expository term but address a different topic or subtopic than assigned

**Example:** Assigned subtopic: "Amphibians" → Direction: "Explain fish habitats" (about fish rather than amphibians)

### Vague or unclear responses

Response might be related but not specific enough to show understanding

**Example:** Direction: "Describe the role of absolute rulers" → Response: "They were important in history"

### Conflicting expository terms that change the focus

Using multiple expository terms that create unclear expectations or contradictory directions

**Example:** Direction: "Compare the water cycle and define what precipitation means" (combines unrelated tasks that should be separate)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Grade Level: 8
Topic: Absolute Rulers
Term: "describe"
Direction: "Describe the role of absolute rulers in medieval Europe."
Response: "Absolute rulers had total control over their countries.""

Clear, direct response that accurately answers the direction in a single sentence.

### Example: "Grade Level: 8
Topic: Absolute Rulers
Term: "enumerate"
Direction: "Enumerate possible reasons for opposition to absolute rulers."
Response: "First, people had no political power. Second, the rulers controlled the practice of religion. Lastly, they had total control over the economy.""

Response lists clear points that directly answer the direction. Note that while this response has multiple points, a single point could also be valid.

### Example: "Grade Level: 8
Topic: Absolute Rulers
Term: "explain"
Direction: "Explain why absolute rulers believed they were entitled to their power."
Response: "Absolute rulers believed that they had a divine right to rule.""

Single-sentence response that clearly explains the key concept. No need for additional detail when the main point is well-made.

### Example: "Grade Level: 6
Topic: Solar System
Term: "describe"
Direction: "Describe how planets move around the sun."
Response: "Planets move in circles around the sun, taking different amounts of time to complete their journey.""

While not technically accurate (planets move in ellipses, not circles), this response demonstrates proper use of the expository term "describe" and shows basic understanding of planetary motion. The factual inaccuracy does not affect the quality of the expository writing.

### Example: "Grade Level: 7
Topic: Water Cycle
Term: "discuss"
Direction: "Discuss the role of the sun in the water cycle and explain how clouds form."
Response: "The sun provides energy that drives evaporation, turning liquid water into water vapor. This vapor rises and cools to form clouds.""

Uses the primary expository term "discuss" correctly while adding a related "explain" component. Since both parts are related to the same topic and the primary term is used appropriately, this is acceptable.

### Example: "Grade Level: 6
Topic: Animals
Subtopic: Mammals
Term: "discuss"
Example Direction: "Discuss the social structure of wolf packs."
Student Direction: "Discuss the hunting techniques used by large predatory cats.""

This is CORRECT because it addresses the subtopic "mammals" (cats are mammals). Students do NOT need to address the exact same specific animal (wolves) shown in the example direction.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: Animals
Subtopic: Amphibians
Term: "explain"
Direction: "Explain fish habitats.""

Uses the required expository term correctly, but addresses a different topic (fish) rather than the assigned subtopic.

### Example: "Topic: Ancient Egypt
Subtopic: Pyramids
Term: "describe"
Direction: "Describe ancient Greek architecture.""

While using the expository term correctly, this direction focuses on a completely different civilization than the assigned topic.

# 10-vivid-vocabulary

## Goal

Encourage students to explore and experiment with language by suggesting alternative words or phrases in a supportive, low-stakes environment.

### Secondary Goals

- Build confidence in trying new vocabulary
- Develop awareness of word choice options
- Foster creativity with language
- Explore topic-related terminology in an approachable way
- Practice recognizing parts of speech in context

## How It Works

This activity follows a friendly, exploratory process:
1. Students are shown a sentence with a highlighted word or phrase
2. They are told the part of speech of this highlighted portion
3. They suggest alternative words or phrases that:
   - Could reasonably replace the original in the sentence
   - Might add interest, detail, or topic connection
   - Work generally well in the context

The goal is word exploration and play, not technical perfection.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept ANY reasonable attempt to provide an alternative word or phrase
Emphasize encouragement over criticism
Be extremely inclusive of semantically adjacent words
Accept words that are less specific or less precise than the original
Consider any on-topic alternative valid unless it is completely unrelated
Value the student's willingness to try new words
Never criticize a good-faith attempt to suggest a related word
Remember the goal is to build confidence and interest in vocabulary

### Level 2

Still be very accepting of a wide range of alternatives
Allow creative approaches to word substitution
Value both descriptive language and topic-specific terminology
Accept words that capture similar meaning, even if not technically perfect
Encourage but don't demand more sophisticated vocabulary choices
Remember that vocabulary acquisition is gradual and non-linear

## Important Principles for Grading

DEFAULT TO ACCEPTANCE of all reasonable attempts
Accept ANY word that could credibly replace the original in context
Avoid pedantic or technical criticism of students' word choices
Even if an alternative is less vivid or specific, accept it if it generally works
Only reject words that are complete grammatical mismatches or entirely off-topic
Never reject synonyms or semantically related terms
Redundancy is perfectly acceptable (e.g., "racing speedily")
Do not nitpick about nuanced distinctions in meaning
Accept alternatives that represent ANY attempt to engage with the assignment
Remember that "typed" → "wrote" is a perfectly valid substitution even though typing is digital and writing can be by hand
Accept "big" → "large" even though they're similar in vividness
In cases of doubt, always accept the student's answer
Value participation and experimentation over precision
For primary school students, accept answers that show any understanding of the task
Remember the goal is to make students feel successful and confident
Accept reasonable grammatical expansions that work in context (e.g., replacing a verb with a verb phrase)
Allow creative multi-word substitutions when they fit the sentence flow
However, DO check that the resulting sentence still makes grammatical sense
For example, a gerund phrase should remain a gerund phrase, not become an infinitive
When the part of speech is specified (noun, verb, gerund, etc.), ensure students maintain that general function, but allow reasonable expansions
Balance acceptance of vocabulary with basic grammatical functionality

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Completely unrelated words

Student provides a word or phrase that has no semantic connection to the original

**Example:** For "teacher" → "banana" (completely unrelated concept)

### Wrong part of speech

Alternative does not function grammatically in the original sentence

**Example:** Original: "They fought" → "They to fight"

### Incorrect grammatical structure

Student changes the required grammatical form in a way that makes the sentence illogical

**Example:** Original: "Walking the dog" (gerund) → "to walk the dog" (infinitive, changes sentence meaning)



## Format Requirements

### The alternative should generally work in the original sentence

**Correct Example:** Original: "A long time ago" → "Many years ago"

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "A long time ago" → "quickly" (does not fit)

### The alternative should maintain the same general function in the sentence, but may expand to a multi-word phrase

**Correct Example:** Original: "yelled" (verb) → "called out loudly" (verb phrase that functions as the main verb)

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "Walking the dog" (gerund phrase as subject) → "to walk the dog" (infinitive phrase, changes sentence function)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: American Revolution
Sentence: "A long time ago, people fought for freedom."
Constituent: "A long time ago"
Alternatives: ["During the Revolutionary War", "in the winter", "in the past", "many years ago", "before I was born"]"

Accept ANY of these alternatives. Some are more specific ("During the Revolutionary War"), others are simple ("in the past"), and others are personal ("before I was born"). ALL are valid.

### Example: "Topic: Ancient Egypt
Sentence: "The ruler lived in a big house."
Constituent: "big house"
Alternatives: ["large home", "palace", "mansion", "pyramid", "temple", "castle"]"

Accept ALL of these alternatives. Some might not be historically accurate (Egyptian rulers didn't live in castles), but they show the student is trying to use different words for a large dwelling.

### Example: "Topic: School
Sentence: "He is a teacher at the local school."
Constituent: "teacher"
Alternatives: ["instructor", "educator", "tutor", "professor", "trainer", "coach", "mentor"]"

Accept ALL of these alternatives. While there are technical differences between these roles, they all relate to education and instruction.

### Example: "Topic: Sports
Sentence: "Running quickly, she reached the finish line first."
Constituent: "Running quickly"
Alternatives: ["Sprinting", "Racing speedily", "Moving fast", "Jogging rapidly", "Dashing", "Hurrying"]"

Accept ALL of these alternatives. They represent various levels of specificity and vividness, but all convey the basic idea of moving quickly.

### Example: "Topic: Education
Sentence: "She typed her essay quickly."
Constituent: "typed"
Alternatives: ["wrote", "drafted", "composed", "created", "prepared", "keyed in", "input"]"

Accept ALL of these alternatives. Even though "wrote" traditionally implies handwriting and "typed" implies using a keyboard, these distinctions are not important for this exercise.

### Example: "Topic: Dog Care
Sentence: "Walking the dog every morning is good exercise."
Constituent: "Walking the dog every morning"
Part of Speech: "gerund phrase"
Alternatives: ["taking the dog out daily" (correct - maintains gerund), "exercising with your pet regularly" (correct - maintains gerund)]"

Both alternatives maintain the gerund form (verb+ing) while changing vocabulary. Alternatives like "to walk the dog daily" would be incorrect because they change to an infinitive structure.

### Example: "Topic: Yelling
Sentence: "She yelled at the top of her lungs."
Constituent: "yelled"
Part of Speech: "verb"
Alternatives: ["shouted", "roared", "called out loudly", "screamed with force"]"

Accept ALL of these alternatives. Some are single verbs ("shouted", "roared") while others are expanded verb phrases ("called out loudly", "screamed with force"). All function correctly as the main verb in the sentence.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: American Revolution
Sentence: "A long time ago, people fought for freedom."
Constituent: "A long time ago"
Alternatives: ["quickly", "upside down", "green"]"

These alternatives don't make sense in the sentence structure and have no semantic relationship to time expressions.

### Example: "Topic: School
Sentence: "He is a teacher at the local school."
Constituent: "teacher"
Alternatives: ["car", "tree", "pencil"]"

These alternatives are completely unrelated to education or instruction.

### Example: "Topic: Dog Care
Sentence: "Walking the dog every morning is good exercise."
Constituent: "Walking the dog every morning"
Part of Speech: "gerund phrase"
Alternatives: ["to walk the dog daily", "walk dog morning"]"

The first alternative changes a gerund phrase to an infinitive phrase, which changes the grammatical structure. The second is missing articles and doesn't maintain the gerund form. Both would need revision to maintain the required gerund structure.

# 11-basic-conjunctions

## Goal

Develop students' analytical thinking by having them express relationships between ideas using basic conjunctions.

### Secondary Goals

- Check student comprehension of content material
- Practice expressing cause-effect relationships
- Learn to show contrasts and changes of direction
- Develop ability to explain reasons clearly

## How It Works

Students are shown a sentence stem that has a conjunction and a missing subsequent clause. The three conjunctions are "because", "but", and "so". Students will be given the sentence stem all the way through to the conjunction, and it's the student's job to finish the rest of the sentence. Each conjunction has a specific purpose: 'because' explains why something is true, 'but' indicates a change of direction, and 'so' shows what happens as a result.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept more straightforward cause-effect relationships. For `but` usage, the contrast must stay on topic but can be more flexible for lower grades.

### Level 2

Expect more sophisticated relationships and contrasts. Can handle curriculum-specific content directly.

## Important Principles for Grading

'because' must explain why something is true, happened, or exists
'but' must show a clear change of direction or contrast within the same topic
'so' must show what happens as a result or a logical follow-up action
Responses must complete the sentence logically and grammatically
A comma is required before 'but' when connecting two independent clauses
Both 'so' and 'so that' constructions are valid but serve different purposes - 'so' shows direct results while 'so that' shows purpose
When grading 'but' usage, the contrast must stay on topic but can be more flexible for lower grades
One spelling error is considered a nit if the spelling error is small. Two or more spelling errors are considered an error.
Missing a comma before "but" or before "so" (unless user wrote "so that") are considered an error. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS.
Including a comma before "because" is considered an error.
Missing an apostrophe is considered a nit.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Using 'so' as an intensifier

Students might use 'so' to mean 'very' rather than to show a result.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'The dog is big, so big!'. Correct: 'The dog is big, so it needs a large bed.'

### Off-topic contrasts with 'but'

Students might introduce unrelated information after 'but'. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'I like pizza, but the sky is blue'. Correct: 'I like pizza, but it's not healthy'

### Weak cause-effect with 'so'

Students might not show clear logical connection. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'It's sunny, so I have a cat'. Correct: 'It's sunny, so I'll wear sunscreen'

### Weak logical connection with 'because'

Students might not show a clear cause-effect relationship. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'She studied hard because the sky is blue'. Correct: 'She studied hard because she wanted to pass the test.'

### Missing comma before 'but'

Students often forget the comma when connecting two independent clauses with 'but. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'I like chocolate but I don't like candy'. Correct: 'I like chocolate, but I don't like candy.'

### Missing comma before 'so' when connecting two independent clauses

Students often forget the comma when connecting two independent clauses with 'so'. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'I was tired so I went to bed early'. Correct: 'I was tired, so I went to bed early.'

### Using 'because' with a comma

Students incorrectly add a comma before 'because'. THIS MISTAKE TYPE IS AN ERROR.

**Example:** Incorrect: 'I stayed home, because I was sick'. Correct: 'I stayed home because I was sick.'



## Format Requirements

### The student's answer will be a complete sentence that includes the original sentence stem and the conjunction.

**Correct Example:** Stem: 'Forests are important _____'. Answer: 'Forests are important because they produce oxygen for us to breathe.'

**Incorrect Example:** Stem: 'Forests are important _____'. Answer: 'because they produce oxygen for us to breathe.'



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Stem: 'Forests are important because _____'. Answer: 'Forests are important because they produce oxygen for us to breathe.'"

Shows clear cause-and-effect relationship explaining why forests matter.

### Example: "Stem: 'The sun gives us light, but _____'. Answer: 'The sun gives us light, but too much exposure can be harmful.'"

Shows valid contrast about the same topic (the sun's effects).

### Example: "Stem: 'It's raining heavily, so _____'. Answer: 'It's raining heavily, so we should stay inside.'"

Shows logical result or reasonable follow-up action.

### Example: "Stem: 'Astronauts float inside the space station during orbit, but _____'. Answer: 'Astronauts float inside the space station during orbit, but in the shuttle they can still feel gravity because of acceleration forces.'"

Correctly uses the required conjunction and includes additional information while using *a second conjunction*, which is perfectly acceptable as long as the sentence is otherwise coherent and grammatical.

### Example: "Stem: 'I enjoy reading books because _____'. Answer: 'I enjoy reading books because they transport me to different worlds'"

This answer is correct in terms of content and conjunction usage, even though it lacks ending punctuation. The missing period should be treated as a "nit" (minor issue) rather than an error that would make the answer incorrect.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Stem: 'The book was interesting, but _____'. Answer: 'The book was interesting, but my dog likes to run.'"

Introduces unrelated topic instead of showing contrast about the book.

### Example: "Stem: 'The water is cold, so _____'. Answer: 'The water is cold, so cold!'"

Uses 'so' as an intensifier instead of showing a result.

# 12-identify-appositives

## Goal

Help students recognize and correctly identify non-essential appositive phrases (nouns or noun phrases set off by commas) within sentences. You'll be given incorrect answers, and youll be required to give feedback as to why the answer is incorrect. All issues are errors.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce understanding that appositives rename or describe a nearby noun
- Build skill in analyzing sentence structure and punctuation
- Distinguish appositives from other types of phrases (like asides or subordinate clauses)
- Ignore essential appositives in this exercise (focus on non-essential, comma-marked structures)

## How It Works

Students are provided with a sentence that may contain zero, one, or multiple appositive phrases.
They must select all the appositive phrases. Non-essential appositives in English are usually set off by commas, but they must also be nouns or noun phrases describing or renaming another noun in the sentence.
Essential appositives (which are not set off by commas) are not in scope for this exercise. Only select the noun phrase(s) set off by commas that serve as appositives.
Feedback focuses on whether students correctly identified all non-essential appositive phrases, without including irrelevant phrases (like introductory asides or subordinate clauses).

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Provide feedback that is free of technical jargon and is easy to understand.

### Level 2

Provide feedback that is free of technical jargon and is easy to understand.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Must Identify Non-Essential Appositives:
- A non-essential appositive adds extra information but can be removed without changing the core meaning of the sentence. It is typically offset by commas.

2. Appositives Are Nouns or Noun Phrases:
- Students should not select verb phrases, subordinate clauses, or asides introduced by parenthetical expressions. Only noun/noun-phrase descriptors that rename another noun.

3. Ignore Essential Appositives for This Activity:
- If an appositive is essential (no commas, integral to the subject's identity), do not mark it. Only focus on the comma-marked, extra-information phrases.

4. Accurate Selecting:
- Students must select the exact phrase that functions as the appositive. Selecting too little or too much is considered incorrect.

5. All issues are errors:
- If the student selects an incorrect appositive, or if they select the wrong part of an appositive, or if they miss an appositive entirely, all of these are considered errors.

6. Selecting the entire sentence is incorrect:
- If the student selects the entire sentence, that is incorrect. Students should only select the appositive phrases.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Identifying asides or subordinate clauses as appositives

Students might confuse any comma-delimited phrase with an appositive. For example, a phrase like "although he was tired" is not a noun phrase and should not be marked.

**Example:** Sentence: "The boy, although he was tired, finished his homework." (Nothing to select here, because "although he was tired" is a subordinate clause, not an appositive.)

### Missing part of the appositive or including words beyond the noun phrase

Students might select only the first word of the phrase or extend the selection to include non-noun elements.

**Example:** Correct: "The artist, **a skilled painter**, created a mural." Incorrect: "The artist, **a skilled painter created** a mural."

### Marking essential appositives or ignoring the requirement of commas

Some appositives might be essential and not set off by commas; these are not to be marked in this activity.

**Example:** Essential: "My friend Bob is here." (no commas, essential info)—should not be selected. Non-essential: "Bob, my friend, is here." (set off by commas)—should be selected.



## Format Requirements

### All non-essential appositive phrases (nouns/noun phrases set off by commas) must be selected.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "Julia, **my closest friend**, lives next door."

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "Julia, **my closest** friend lives next door." (The selection cuts off part of the noun phrase)

### Do not select phrases that are not noun/noun phrases describing another noun, even if set off by commas.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "Daniel, **the captain of our team**, is giving a speech."

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "Daniel, **the captain of our team, is** giving a speech." (This includes verb material that is not part of the noun phrase)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "My father, **a talented musician**, plays the piano.""

Appositive phrase "a talented musician" is a non-essential noun phrase describing "my father."

### Example: "Sentence: "The queen, **Elizabeth II**, reigned for many years.""

"Elizabeth II" is a non-essential noun phrase that renames "The queen." The commas indicate a non-essential appositive.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "The car, although quite old, still runs smoothly." → Selected: "The car, **although quite old**, still runs smoothly.""

"although quite old" is not a noun phrase; it's a subordinate clause (an adjectival phrase), not an appositive.

### Example: "Sentence: "My friend Bob is here." → Selected: "My friend **Bob** is here.""

This is an essential appositive (identifies which friend specifically), no commas are used, so it's outside the scope of this exercise.



---

# 13-write-appositives

## Goal

Enable students to create and insert correct non-essential appositive phrases (noun/noun phrase set off by commas) into sentences.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop an understanding of appositive structures and the function they serve
- Reinforce punctuation rules for non-essential (comma-delimited) appositives
- Improve sentence variety and clarity by using descriptive noun phrases
- Distinguish valid appositives from other types of clauses or phrases (e.g., subordinate clauses)

## How It Works

1. Students are given a sentence with one or more blanks, each specifically designated for a non-essential appositive.
2. They must fill each blank with a noun or noun phrase that renames or describes the adjacent noun, ensuring the phrase is correctly punctuated with commas.
3. The inserted appositive should be non-essential, meaning the sentence would remain grammatically complete and coherent without it (though less descriptive).
4. Feedback will focus on whether the student’s filled-in phrase is a proper non-essential appositive, rather than a subordinate clause, verb phrase, or essential identifier.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Use short, straightforward sentences and simpler, clearly defined blanks. Example: "My cousin, _______, visited me today."

### Level 2

Allow more complex sentences or multiple blanks. Example: "His puppy, _______, ran across the yard toward my friend, _______, who was holding a treat."

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Must Be a Noun or Noun Phrase:
- The inserted phrase should rename or describe the nearby noun. Avoid verb phrases, subordinate clauses, or extra commentary that is not noun-based.

2. Non-Essential and Set Off by Commas:
- The phrase must be placed between commas (or after a comma if at the end of the sentence) to show it is an optional descriptor.

3. Logical and Contextually Relevant:
- The inserted appositive should make sense in context, describing the noun realistically. Wildly off-topic or contradictory phrases can be flagged, though some creative freedom is allowed if the grammar is correct.

4. Minor spelling errors are allowed:
- If the student makes a minor spelling error or something similar, it is still correct. Just write the issue as a nit instead of an error.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Inserting a subordinate clause or verb phrase instead of a noun phrase

Students might write something like "who was always smiling" or "running through the field," which are not noun phrases.

**Example:** Sentence: "Mia, _______, is traveling to Paris." Filled with: "who loves photography" (subordinate clause, not an appositive).

### Forgetting commas or misplacing them

The student might add the appositive but fail to offset it properly, losing the non-essential structure.

**Example:** Sentence: "Jake _______ scored the winning goal." Filled with: "a fast runner" but without commas → "Jake a fast runner scored the winning goal."

### Providing an essential identifier or partial phrase that changes the sentence structure

If the inserted phrase is required to identify the noun (and thus shouldn’t be offset by commas), it’s not a non-essential appositive.

**Example:** Sentence: "His friend, _______, arrived late to class." Filled with: "Bob" but removing commas → "His friend Bob arrived late..." This indicates an essential appositive, not non-essential.



## Format Requirements

### Fill the blank(s) with a non-essential noun or noun phrase set off by commas.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "Lisa, **my best friend**, is coming over this evening."

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "Lisa **my best friend** is coming over this evening." (missing commas)

### Ensure the inserted phrase logically renames or describes the adjacent noun, not a different entity in the sentence.

**Correct Example:** Sentence: "The city, **a sprawling metropolis**, is known for its diverse culture."

**Incorrect Example:** Sentence: "The city, **with many people walking**, is known for its diverse culture." (This phrase starts to function more like a participle clause than a noun phrase.)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "My cousin, _______, baked an apple pie for Thanksgiving." → Filled with "an accomplished chef": "My cousin, an accomplished chef, baked an apple pie for Thanksgiving.""

This is correct because the phrase "an accomplished chef" is a non-essential noun phrase describing the cousin. It is appropriately set off by commas.

### Example: "Sentence: "_______, the capital of France, is a popular tourist destination." → Filled with "Paris": "Paris, the capital of France, is a popular tourist destination.""

This is correct because it is a classic example of a non-essential appositive giving extra info about "Paris."

### Example: "Sentence: "The museum, _______, attracts visitors from around the world." → Filled with "a historic building with impressive architecture": "The museum, a historic building with impressive architecture, attracts visitors from around the world.""

This is correct because the phrase "a historic building with impressive architecture" is a non-essential noun phrase that provides additional information about the museum. It is correctly set off by commas.

### Example: "Sentence: "The restaurant, _______, serves delicious pasta." → Filled with "my dentist's favorite hangout": "The restaurant, my dentist's favorite hangout, serves delicious pasta.""

This is correct because while this appositive "my dentist's favorite hangout" may seem unusual or unexpected, it is grammatically correct as a noun phrase that renames "The restaurant." The phrase is properly set off by commas and maintains the structure of a non-essential appositive, even though the connection between restaurants and dentists isn't immediately obvious.

### Example: "Sentence: "My mom, _______, made dinner." → Filled with "my dad's wife" → "My mom, my dad's best friend, made dinner.""

This is correct because "my dad's wife" is a noun phrase that renames "My mom." While this creates a somewhat redundant or circular description (since "my mom" and "my dad's wife" typically refer to the same person in a traditional family), it still follows the grammatical structure of an appositive. The phrase is properly set off by commas and maintains the required noun phrase structure, even if the relationship described seems obvious or unnecessary.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Sentence: "My neighbor, _______, has a brand-new puppy." → Filled with "who is always kind" → "My neighbor, who is always kind, has a brand-new puppy.""

This is incorrect because the fill-in phrase "who is always kind" is a relative clause, not a noun phrase. It describes the neighbor but doesn't rename the noun. To be correct, the filled-in appositive must be a noun or noun phrase that provides additional information about the noun it follows.

### Example: "Sentence: "The basketball player, _______, scored thirty points last night." → Filled with "running fast down the court" → "The basketball player, running fast down the court, scored thirty points last night.""

This is incorrect because the fill-in phrase is a participial phrase showing action rather than a noun phrase that renames the basketball player. To be correct, the filled-in appositive must be a noun or noun phrase that provides additional information about the noun it follows.

### Example: "Sentence: "My dog, _______, sleeps on the couch." → Filled with "is very fluffy" → "My dog, is very fluffy, sleeps on the couch.""

This is incorrect because "is very fluffy" is a verb phrase, not a noun phrase. An appositive needs to be a noun or noun phrase that renames or provides additional information about the noun it follows.

### Example: "Sentence: "The chef prepared salmon, _______, for the special dinner." → Filled with "carefully and with attention to detail" → "The chef prepared salmon, carefully and with attention to detail, for the special dinner.""

This is incorrect because "carefully and with attention to detail" is an adverbial phrase describing how the action was performed, not a noun phrase renaming "salmon." Appositives must be noun phrases that rename or provide additional information about another noun.

### Example: "Sentence: "My grandmother, _______, tells wonderful stories." → Filled with "a stories teller amazing" → "My grandmother, a stories teller amazing, tells wonderful stories.""

This is incorrect because "a stories teller amazing" is grammatically incorrect. The word order is wrong and doesn't follow English syntax rules. A proper appositive would be a grammatically correct noun phrase like "an amazing storyteller."

### Example: "Sentence: "We visited Paris, _______, during our summer vacation." → Filled with "where the Eiffel Tower stands" → "We visited Paris, where the Eiffel Tower stands, during our summer vacation.""

This is incorrect because "where the Eiffel Tower stands" is a relative clause, not a noun phrase. While it does provide information about Paris, it doesn't function as an appositive because it doesn't rename the noun.

# 13A-brainstorm-appositives

## Goal

Help students practice writing appositives that effectively rename or describe nouns while maintaining grammatical correctness and factual accuracy.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop understanding of noun phrases and their functions
- Practice using articles and possessives correctly
- Build topic knowledge through descriptive writing
- Learn to provide relevant, accurate details about subjects
- Master proper punctuation with appositives

## How It Works

This activity follows a structured process:
1. Students are given a subject and context about that subject
2. They must write an appositive that renames or describes the subject
3. The appositive must:
   - Be a noun phrase (not a verb or participial phrase)
   - Accurately describe or rename the subject
   - Be factually correct based on the given context

The goal is to help students practice different ways of describing or renaming nouns while maintaining accuracy.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept simpler noun phrases that clearly rename or describe
Be more lenient with factual precision while maintaining basic accuracy
Look for clear connection to the subject
Focus on the use of appositives as a writing skill rather than factual knowledge
Accept minor inaccuracies if the appositive generally relates to the subject

### Level 2

Expect more sophisticated noun phrases
Look for varied use of articles and possessives
Be lenient with factual precision - more interested in writing skills than content knowledge
Expect appositives that show understanding of the subject, but allow for some creative interpretation
Value creative but reasonably accurate descriptions
Accept minor historical or factual imprecisions that don't fundamentally misrepresent the subject

## Important Principles for Grading

Remember that students are submitting appositives in isolation, NOT within sentences - do NOT evaluate for punctuation like commas that would be needed in a sentence context
Must be a noun phrase - can include modifying elements like adjectives, prepositional phrases, or relative clauses
Must begin with a determiner (articles like a, an, the), quantifiers (one of, some of, many), possessives (her, his, its, their, your, our, etc.), or other appropriate noun phrase openers
Must be generally accurate based on the given context - minor factual or historical imprecisions are acceptable
Focus should be on the grammatical construction of the appositive rather than perfect factual accuracy
Only reject descriptions that directly contradict the given context or that are completely unrelated to the subject
Should add meaningful information about the subject
Grammar and structure must be correct
Creativity is good but basic logical accuracy is also important
Complex appositives with relative clauses (e.g., "an artist who depicted pain") are valid, especially for more advanced students
Remember this is a writing exercise, not a history or science test - prioritize writing skills over content knowledge
Excessive repetition among multiple submissions should be flagged as an error, not just a nit - students should demonstrate variety in their appositives
Minor factual inaccuracies should be flagged as a nit, but major contradictions of the context should be flagged as an error
Minor spelling errors should be flagged as a nit
Appositives should be concise; excessively long appositives should be flagged as an error

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Using verb phrases or participial phrases as the main structure

Students often use action words as the main structure instead of starting with a noun phrase

**Example:** "running quickly" or "standing tall" instead of "a fast runner" or "a tall figure"

### Submitting repetitive or nearly identical appositives

Students might submit multiple appositives that convey essentially the same information with minimal variation

**Example:** For "The Eiffel Tower": "a famous landmark in Paris", "a well-known landmark in Paris", "a popular landmark in Paris"

### Factually incorrect descriptions

Students might write descriptions that contradict the context

**Example:** For "Marie Curie": "a famous painter" (when context clearly states she was a scientist)

### Using complete independent sentences

Students might write full independent sentences instead of noun phrases

**Example:** "She discovered radium" instead of "the discoverer of radium" or "a scientist who discovered radium"



## Format Requirements

### Must be a noun phrase that starts with an appropriate determiner, quantifier, or possessive; can include modifying elements like adjectives, prepositional phrases, or relative clauses

**Correct Example:** "a pioneering scientist", "the discoverer of radium", "an artist who depicted personal pain", "one of the greatest athletes of all time"

**Incorrect Example:** "discovered radium", "working in her lab", "she won awards"

### Must be generally accurate based on context, though minor factual imprecisions are acceptable

**Correct Example:** For "Marie Curie": "a Nobel Prize winner", "the first woman who won two Nobel Prizes", "the Polish scientist who studied radiation"

**Incorrect Example:** For "Marie Curie": "a famous painter", "the first person on the moon" (completely unrelated to the subject)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Subject: "Marie Curie"
Context: "Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist who conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity."
Appositives:
- "a pioneering scientist"
- "a renowned researcher"
- "the discoverer of radium""

Uses proper noun phrases, starts with articles, maintains factual accuracy, and adds meaningful information.

### Example: "Subject: "The Empire State Building"
Context: "The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was the tallest building in the world for many years."
Appositives:
- "a famous New York landmark"
- "an Art Deco masterpiece"
- "the iconic skyscraper""

Shows variety in article usage, maintains accuracy, and provides relevant descriptions.

### Example: "Subject: "Frida Kahlo"
Context: "Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits and works that explored themes of identity, gender, and personal suffering."
Appositives:
- "an artist who depicted personal pain in vivid color"
- "a Mexican painter whose work challenged conventional boundaries"
- "the creator who transformed her suffering into powerful art""

Demonstrates valid complex appositives that include relative clauses. Each starts with an article followed by a noun, then uses a relative clause to add descriptive detail.

### Example: "Subject: "Serena Williams"
Context: "Serena Williams is an American professional tennis player who has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles."
Appositives:
- "one of the greatest athletes of all time"
- "the dominant force in women's tennis"
- "a powerful advocate for equality in sports""

Shows valid appositives with different openers: a quantifier ("one of"), an article with adjective, and a standard article start. All effectively describe the subject.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Subject: "Marie Curie"
Context: "Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist who conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity."
Appositives:
- "working in her laboratory" (verb phrase as main structure)
- "famous scientist" (missing article)
- "she won many awards" (independent clause)"

Contains verb phrases as the main structure, missing articles, and uses independent clauses instead of noun phrases.

### Example: "Subject: "Alexander Graham Bell"
Context: "Alexander Graham Bell was a Scottish-born inventor and scientist who is credited with inventing the telephone."
Appositives:
- "a famous author who wrote many novels" (completely unrelated to the context)
- "the English politician from London" (directly contradicts multiple facts in the context)"

Contains appositives that completely contradict or are unrelated to the information provided in the context. The first appositive attributes a completely different profession and achievement. The second contradicts his nationality and profession.

### Example: "Subject: "The Great Barrier Reef"
Context: "The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometers."
Appositives:
- "a beautiful natural wonder"
- "a stunning natural wonder"
- "an amazing natural wonder""

Demonstrates repetitive appositives that lack variety. All three use nearly identical structure and convey essentially the same information with minimal differentiation, failing to add new descriptive elements about the subject.

# 14-subordinating-conjunctions

## Goal

Have students complete a subordinating conjunction stem into a full, coherent sentence with proper comma placement.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce the role of subordinating conjunctions in creating dependent clauses
- Encourage logical and meaningful connections between the dependent clause and the independent clause
- Enforce comma usage when the dependent clause precedes the main clause
- Note minor mechanical errors as “nits,” but missing the comma or producing a fragment is a major error

## How It Works

1. A sentence stem begins with a subordinating conjunction and partial dependent clause (e.g., "Although plants need sunlight to grow ______.").
2. Students complete the stem by adding words or phrases after the subordinating conjunction, ensuring they form a coherent dependent clause followed by an independent clause.
3. The completed sentence must include a comma to separate the initial dependent clause from the main clause, as required by standard grammar rules.
4. Feedback addresses both correctness of the subordinating conjunction usage and the presence of proper punctuation (especially the comma).
5. Remember that the student has no control over the subordinate clause, so do not penalize them for the subordinate clause. Only examine the following dependent clause, and checking to see if it makes sense given the subordinate clause supplied.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Keep stems simple and ensure the subordinating conjunction is clearly at the start. Emphasize basic cause/effect or contrast relationships (e.g., "Although," "Because," "When").

### Level 2

Encourage more complex or creative completions. Students might add descriptive phrases, but must still maintain correct sentence structure and comma placement.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Complete Sentence:
- The final sentence must have a dependent clause (introduced by the given subordinating conjunction) and a coherent independent clause.

2. Mandatory Comma Placement:
- When the dependent clause comes first, students must insert a comma before the independent clause starts. Forgetting the comma is considered an error, not a minor “nit.”

3. Logical Connection:
- The dependent clause must logically relate to the main clause (cause/effect, contrast, condition, time, etc.).

4. Minor Errors vs. Major Errors:
- Spelling slips or minor capitalization issues are “nits.” Missing commas, fragments, or severely ungrammatical sentences that obscure meaning are major errors.
5. Students have no control over the subordinate clause, so do not penalize them for the subordinate clause. Only examine the following dependent clause, and checking to see if it makes sense given the subordinate clause supplied. You should NEVER ask them to change the subordinate clause. Only ever ask them to change the independent clause if there's an error. If the only issue is in the subordinate clause, then you should not penalize them for it, and just mark teh answer as correct.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Failing to include a comma after the dependent clause

Students may write the dependent clause at the beginning but omit the comma, leading to a punctuation error.

**Example:** Stem: "Although plants need sunlight to grow" → "Although plants need sunlight to grow they can still be placed in partial shade." (missing comma)

### Producing a fragment or run-on instead of a complete sentence

If students only complete part of the thought or continue without a proper independent clause, the sentence is incomplete or becomes a run-on.

**Example:** Stem: "When the dog barked loudly" → "When the dog barked loudly and woke the neighbors." (missing independent clause)

### Lacking logical consistency between clauses

The second clause may contradict or fail to relate sensibly to the first.

**Example:** Stem: "Although the weather was freezing" → "Although the weather was freezing, I enjoy classical music." (no meaningful connection between temperature and music preference)



## Format Requirements

### Include a comma after the dependent clause if it appears at the start of the sentence. The sentence must stand alone as a complete thought.

**Correct Example:** Stem: "Although plants need sunlight to grow" → "Although plants need sunlight to grow, some species can survive in low light conditions."

**Incorrect Example:** Stem: "Although plants need sunlight to grow" → "Although plants need sunlight to grow they can survive in low light conditions." (missing comma)

### Maintain grammatical coherence and a clear logical link between the dependent clause and the main clause.

**Correct Example:** Stem: "Since the power went out" → "Since the power went out, we lit candles to see in the dark."

**Incorrect Example:** Stem: "Since the power went out" → "Since the power went out, the cat is fluffy." (no logical connection)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Stem: "Although plants need sunlight to grow" → "Although plants need sunlight to grow, many indoor species thrive under artificial light.""

Complete sentence, logically connected, comma separates the dependent clause from the main clause.

### Example: "Stem: "When the fire alarm rang" → "When the fire alarm rang, everyone calmly exited the building.""

The dependent clause sets the time context; the main clause completes the thought. The comma is placed correctly.

### Example: "Stem: "Until the bell ring" → "Until the bell ring, we must stay in our seats.""

Despite the grammatical error in the subordinate clause ("bell ring" instead of "bell rings"), the response is considered correct because it properly completes the sentence with a comma and a logically connected independent clause.

### Example: "Stem: "Whenever it be raining" → "Whenever it be raining, the dog hides under the bed.""

Although the subordinate clause contains non-standard grammar ("it be raining" instead of "it is raining"), the answer is marked correct because it includes the required comma and provides a logical independent clause that completes the thought.

### Example: "Stem: "Whenever it is raining" → "whenever it is raining, the dog hides under the bed.""

The submitted sentence starts with a lowercase letter, but this is a NIT, not an error.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Stem: "Although plants need sunlight to grow" → "Although plants need sunlight to grow they can adapt to shade in some cases.""

No comma before "they," resulting in a punctuation error. This is considered more than a minor "nit."

### Example: "Stem: "When the movie ended" → "When the movie ended." (Incomplete thought)"

This remains a fragment; the student did not add an independent clause after the subordinating conjunction clause.

### Example: "Stem: "Since it was raining heavily" → "Since it was raining heavily, we decided to have our picnic outside.""

The response lacks logical coherence because people typically avoid outdoor activities like picnics during heavy rain. The main clause contradicts common sense given the weather condition described in the dependent clause.

### Example: "Stem: "If you study regularly" → "If you study regularly, your grades will get worse.""

The response contains a logical contradiction. Regular studying typically leads to improved grades, not worse ones. While the sentence is grammatically correct with proper comma placement, it fails to maintain a logical relationship between the dependent and independent clauses.

# 15-combine-sentences

## Goal

Teach students to combine multiple short sentences into a single, fluid, and grammatically correct sentence using appropriate conjunctions or other linking methods.

### Secondary Goals

- Encourage variety in sentence structure (coordinating/subordinating conjunctions, transitional phrases, etc.)
- Improve writing fluency and reduce choppy prose
- Identify minor errors while focusing on correctness of the combined sentence's structure and meaning

## How It Works

Students receive two or more related sentences (e.g., "I went to the store. I bought some apples.") and must merge them into one cohesive sentence while preserving meaning (e.g., "I went to the store and bought some apples."). Students may use conjunctions, transitional phrases, or subordinate clauses to combine ideas effectively.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Keep initial sentences short and straightforward. Encourage basic coordinating conjunctions ("and," "but"). Emphasize avoiding run-ons.

### Level 2

Use more complex sentence sets that can be combined with subordinating conjunctions ("because," "although," "when") or transitional phrases. Focus on maintaining clarity while varying sentence structure.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Error Hierarchy:
   a) Critical Errors (mark as incorrect):
      - Run-ons and comma splices
      - Sentence fragments
      - Missing key information from original sentences
      - Dangling modifiers (e.g., "Walking through the park, the flowers smelled wonderful")
      - Changed meaning or added information not in original sentences
   b) Major Errors (generally mark as incorrect):
      - Inappropriate connector choice that creates illogical relationship
      - Multiple minor errors of the same type (3+ spelling/punctuation errors)
   c) Minor Errors ("nits" - note but accept as correct):
      - 1-2 minor spelling or punctuation errors that don't affect meaning
      - Less optimal but still logical connector choice

2. Connector Appropriateness:
   - Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet) for equal-importance ideas
   - Subordinating conjunctions (because, although, when) for expressing relationships
   - Connector should match the logical relationship between ideas:
     * Cause/effect → because, so, therefore
     * Contrast → but, however, although, while
     * Sequence → then, after, before, while
     * Addition → and, additionally, moreover

3. Sentence Structure:
   - Final sentence must be complete and grammatically correct
   - Accept various combining methods: conjunctions, subordinate clauses, phrases
   - Proper punctuation required for the chosen structure

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Critical Structure Errors

Run-ons, comma splices, fragments, or dangling modifiers create grammatically incorrect sentences.

**Example:** Incorrect: "I went to the store, I bought apples." (comma splice) or "Walking through the park, the flowers smelled wonderful." (dangling modifier)

### Information Loss or Distortion

Missing key details or changing the meaning of the original sentences.

**Example:** Original: "She finished her homework. She went to the park afterward." → Incorrect: "She finished her homework." (missing the park information)

### Inappropriate Connector Choice

Using connectors that don't match the logical relationship between ideas.

**Example:** Original: "It was raining. I decided not to go outside." → Poor: "It was raining and I decided not to go outside." (Better: "Because it was raining, I decided not to go outside.")



## Format Requirements

### One complete sentence that incorporates all ideas from the original sentences with appropriate logical connections.

**Correct Example:** Original: "He woke up early. He went for a run." → Combined: "He woke up early and went for a run." or "After waking up early, he went for a run."

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "He woke up early. He went for a run." → Incorrect: "He woke up early he went for a run." (run-on) or "He woke up early." (incomplete)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Original: "We traveled to Spain. We enjoyed the local cuisine. We visited several museums." → Combined: "We traveled to Spain, enjoyed the local cuisine, and visited several museums.""

Uses parallel structure with proper punctuation to combine all ideas into a fluid sentence.

### Example: "Original: "The storm was intense. We decided to stay indoors." → Combined: "Because the storm was intense, we decided to stay indoors.""

Uses appropriate subordinating conjunction to establish cause-effect relationship.

### Example: "Original: "The student arrived at school early. The student finished the assignment before class." → Combined: "Arriving at school early, the student finished the assignment before class.""

Uses a participial phrase correctly to show relationship between actions while avoiding dangling modifiers.

### Example: "Original: "She helps clean kids' teeth. Barbie wears white dental scrubs." → Combined: "Barbie helps clean kids' teeth, so she wears white dental scrubs.""

This correctly identifies that "She" refers to "Barbie" and uses "so" to establish a logical connection. Though "because" might create a more natural causal relationship, "so" is still correct here and maintains the meaning of both original sentences.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Original: "She loves to paint. She hates the smell of turpentine." → Combined: "She loves to paint she hates the smell of turpentine.""

Critical Error: Run-on sentence without proper conjunction or punctuation.

### Example: "Original: "The garden is full of flowers. The bees are buzzing around." → Combined: "The garden is full of flowers, the bees are buzzing around.""

Critical Error: Comma splice - incorrectly uses a comma between independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction.

### Example: "Original: "Walking through the park. The flowers smelled wonderful." → Combined: "Walking through the park, the flowers smelled wonderful.""

Critical Error: Dangling modifier - "Walking through the park" incorrectly modifies "the flowers", suggesting the flowers were walking.

# 16-kernel-expansion

## Goal

Help students process and understand new information by expanding simple sentences with relevant details that address specific questions.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop ability to anticipate what information readers need
- Practice note-taking skills using key words and phrases
- Learn to identify and express essential information
- Build content knowledge through structured expansion
- Master proper sentence construction while adding detail

## How It Works

This activity follows a structured three-step process:
1. Students are given a brief but complete kernel sentence (e.g., "It sprouts.")
2. They are provided specific question words (some or all of: who, what, when, where, why, how)
3. Students first answer each question word in isolation, then must combine both these and the kernel sentence into an expanded sentence

The expanded sentence must:
- Include all information from the answers to the question words
- Maintain grammatical correctness
- Keep the original meaning of the kernel

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on basic question words (when, where, why) and simple expansions. Notes should use only key words and phrases, not abbreviations. Expect straightforward additions that clarify the kernel sentence.

### Level 2

Work with all question words and more complex expansions. Students can use abbreviations and symbols in notes. Expect more sophisticated relationships between added information.

## Important Principles for Grading

The kernel sentence must remain intact (except for pronouns)
All question word answers must be incorporated
If "when" is a question word, the expanded sentence must begin the "when" information. Other expanded clauses can be placed either at the beginning or end.
Added information must be logically connected to the kernel
The expanded sentence must be grammatically correct
Students should not add new information beyond their question word answers. It's okay to add a little new information, like a new word, but two or more new words are considered new information, and that's an error.
Students have no control over the kernel sentence, so you should not penalize them for the kernel sentence.
Student's answers to the question words must be correct. If they are wrong, they should not get credit for the question word.
The "how" question word can be answered in two ways: (1) with an adverb describing manner (e.g., "slowly", "carefully"), or (2) with a phrase describing the method (e.g., "by using a calculator", "with great effort").
Single misspellings, missed apostrophes, ambiguous pronouns, factual errors, etc. are considered nits. Do not classify the severity of those as errors.
Run-on sentences are considered errors.
Answers to the "who" question word can be both the subject and the object of the sentence.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Changing the kernel

Students might modify or rephrase the kernel sentence instead of expanding it

**Example:** Kernel: "She reads." → "The girl studied." (changes the kernel instead of expanding it)

### Missing question answers

Not incorporating all the information from their question word answers

**Example:** Questions: When? (at night) Where? (in bed) → Only uses one answer: "She reads at night."

### Wrong "when" placement

Not starting with the "when" information when it was one of the question words

**Example:** When? (after dinner) → "She reads her book after dinner" instead of "After dinner, she reads her book."

### Adding significant pieces of extra information

Including major details not provided in question word answers like whole new locations, people, or scenarios. Minor details are ok though, like adverbs or verbs or adjectives.

**Example:** Kernel: "She reads."
Where? (in the park)
When? (early morning)
Why? (she likes the quiet)
Expanded: "She reads in the park early morning because she likes the quiet."

### Answering question words incorrectly

Students might misinterpret what information each question word is asking for, leading to incorrect answers in their notes

**Example:** Question: "How do birds fly?"
Student answer: "When? in the sky" (confusing "how" with "where")

### Using wrong question word answers in the expanded sentence

Students might correctly identify question word answers in their notes but incorporate them incorrectly in their expanded sentence

**Example:** Kernel: "Artists create."
How? skillfully
What? paintings
Expanded: "Artists create at night paintings." (using "at night" for "how" instead of "skillfully")

### Confusing similar question words

Students might confuse "how" (manner/method) with "why" (reason/purpose) or "where" (location) with "when" (time)

**Example:** Kernel: "Students study."
Why? to learn
How? diligently
Expanded: "Students study diligently to get good grades." (using a different reason than what was noted)



## Format Requirements

### Notes must be in proper format (key words/phrases, appropriate abbreviations for Level 2)

**Correct Example:** Where? library
When? after school
Why? finish book report

**Incorrect Example:** Where? She went to the library
When? It was after school

### Expanded sentence must incorporate all question word answers

**Correct Example:** Kernel: "He plays."
Where? playground
When? recess
Expanded: "During recess, he plays on the playground."

**Incorrect Example:** Kernel: "He plays."
Where? playground
When? recess
Expanded: "He plays at recess." (missing where)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Kernel: "It melts."
What? ice cream
Where? sidewalk
When? hot afternoon
Expanded: "On a hot afternoon, the ice cream melts on the sidewalk.""

Starts with "when," includes all question answers, maintains kernel meaning, and is grammatically correct.

### Example: "Kernel: "They migrate."
What? monarch butterflies
Where? Mexico
When? October
Why? find warm climate
Expanded: "In October, monarch butterflies migrate to Mexico to find a warm climate.""

Properly expands with all information while maintaining clear logical connections.

### Example: "Kernel: "Birds fly."
Where? sky
How? gracefully
Expanded: "Birds fly gracefully across the clear blue sky.""

Adds minor descriptive details ("clear blue") that enhance the sentence without changing its core meaning or adding significant new information.

### Example: "Kernel: "She reads."
What? novels
When? evening
Expanded: "In the evening, she reads interesting novels.""

Includes small details ("interesting") that enrich the sentence while maintaining focus on the required question word answers.

### Example: "Kernel: "The cat sleeps."
Where? windowsill
When? afternoon
Expanded: "In the afternoon, the cat sleeps on the windowsill""

This answer correctly incorporates all question word answers and maintains the kernel meaning, but is missing ending punctuation. This should be treated as a "nit" rather than an error, and the submission should be graded as correct.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Kernel: "She writes."
Where? desk
When? morning
Expanded: "The student completed her homework at her desk." (changes kernel instead of expanding it)"

Changes the original kernel sentence instead of expanding it with the given information.

### Example: "Kernel: "It grows."
What? plant
Where? garden
When? spring
Why? good soil
Expanded: "In spring, it grows in the garden." (missing what and why information)"

Fails to incorporate all the information from the question word answers.

### Example: "Kernel: "He runs."
Where? park
When? morning
Expanded: "In the morning, he runs in the park with his dog who just had surgery." (adds major new information)"

Adds significant new information ("with his dog who just had surgery") that goes beyond minor descriptive details and introduces a completely new element to the sentence.

### Example: "Kernel: "They swim."
Where? lake
How? quickly
Expanded: "They swim quickly across the lake to escape from the approaching storm." (adds major new scenario)"

Introduces a major new scenario ("to escape from the approaching storm") that changes the context and purpose of the action rather than simply expanding the kernel.

### Example: "Kernel: "The dog barked."
When? yesterday
Where? backyard
Expanded: "The dog barked in the backyard yesterday." (when not at beginning)"

Fails to begin the sentence with the "when" information, which is required when expanding sentences with time elements.

### Example: "Kernel: "Artists create."
How? at night
What? paintings
Expanded: "Artists create at night paintings." (incorrect question word identification)"

Incorrectly identifies "at night" as answering "how" when it actually answers "when" the artists create.

### Example: "Kernel: "Students study."
Why? diligently
Where? in libraries
Expanded: "Students study diligently in libraries." (incorrect question word identification)"

Incorrectly identifies "diligently" as answering "why" when it actually answers "how" the students study.

### Example: "Kernel: "Bears hibernate."
When? peacefully
Expanded: "Bears hibernate peacefully in winter." (incorrect question word identification)"

Incorrectly identifies "peacefully" as answering "when" when it actually answers "how" the bears hibernate.

### Example: "Kernel: "Writers compose."
What? to express themselves
Why? stories
Expanded: "Writers compose stories to express themselves." (swapped question word answers)"

Swaps the answers to "what" and "why" - "stories" answers what they compose, while "to express themselves" answers why they compose.

# 19-identify-topic-sentence

## Goal

Ensure students can distinguish a topic sentence from supporting details within a short paragraph.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce the characteristics of a topic sentence (general statement introducing the main idea)
- Help students understand how supporting details expand or explain the topic sentence
- Provide clear, instructive feedback for incorrect selections, focusing on the difference between a broad, introductory statement and more specific, supporting statements

## How It Works

1. Students see several sentences drawn from a short paragraph, but they are shuffled.
2. They must identify which one of the sentences is the best candidate for the topic sentence.
3. The "correct" topic sentence has been predetermined. If a student chooses incorrectly, the system explains why that particular sentence works better as a supporting detail rather than a topic sentence.
4. Feedback should highlight the differences between topic sentences (broad statements introducing the main idea) and supporting details (specific evidence or examples).

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Use very clear, straightforward paragraphs where the topic sentence is obviously more general than the details. Keep supporting details distinctly narrower.

### Level 2

Encourage more subtle paragraphs in which the topic sentence might not always appear first, and supporting sentences might include mini-generalizations. Students must carefully discern which sentence best encapsulates the main idea.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Broad vs. Specific:
- A topic sentence generally presents a broad idea that the rest of the paragraph will expand upon. Supporting details are narrower, providing examples or evidence.

2. Previewing the Main Idea:
- The topic sentence often gives a hint of what the entire paragraph will discuss. Supporting details usually do not contain the "big picture."

3. Cohesiveness of the Paragraph:
- If removing the chosen sentence breaks the paragraph’s overall theme, it’s probably the topic sentence. Meanwhile, removing a supporting detail might not diminish the central idea as much (though it loses specificity).

4. Feedback Emphasis:
- When an incorrect choice is made, the feedback should clarify that the selected sentence is either too specific, an example, or a minor point rather than the overarching main idea.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Selecting a very specific or example-driven sentence as the topic

Students may misinterpret an interesting fact or example as the main idea, even though it is really supporting detail.

**Example:** Topic: "Renewable energy is the future of power generation." → Supporting detail: "Solar panels can reduce electric bills by up to 50%." (too specific for a topic sentence)

### Choosing a transitional or concluding statement instead of the main idea

Some paragraphs might end with a concluding or summarizing line, which is not necessarily the broad topic sentence introducing the main idea.

**Example:** Paragraph: "Traveling offers new experiences. You can see unique cultures and try different foods. In conclusion, these adventures can broaden your perspective." → The last sentence is a concluding statement, not the main topic sentence.



## Format Requirements

### Students must pick exactly one sentence that serves as the topic sentence, avoiding confusion with supporting details.

**Correct Example:** Choosing a sentence that broadly introduces the paragraph’s main point, e.g., "Robots are changing the way people work."

**Incorrect Example:** Selecting a detail sentence, e.g., "Many robots are used in assembly lines," which is more specific and supports the broader idea of robots changing the workforce.

### The system should provide instructive feedback if an incorrect sentence is chosen, explaining why it is more of a supporting detail or concluding statement than a topic sentence.

**Correct Example:** Feedback: "This sentence focuses on a specific fact or example. A topic sentence is broader and introduces the main idea for the entire paragraph."

**Incorrect Example:** No feedback or unhelpful feedback that doesn’t highlight the difference between a topic sentence and a supporting sentence.



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic sentence selection: "Many cities are investing in green technology to combat climate change." (broad statement introducing the main idea)"

This statement sets up the paragraph’s overall direction—how and why cities invest in green tech. It is not a specific detail but a general assertion.

### Example: "Supporting detail (incorrect choice): "In 2020, Chicago allocated $2 million to build new bike lanes.""

This sentence is narrower, illustrating a specific instance of a city investing in green technology, rather than stating the overall main idea.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic sentence selection: "For instance, I love reading mystery novels." (incorrect for a paragraph about the benefits of reading for mental health)"

Feedback should clarify that this sentence is just a personal example, not a broad statement introducing reading’s mental health benefits. It’s too narrow and example-based.

### Example: "Topic sentence selection: "Frogs can be found on every continent except Antarctica." (incorrect if the main paragraph idea is about how amphibians adapt to diverse environments)"

Feedback clarifies that this sentence is a detail about frogs’ geographical distribution rather than the overarching concept of amphibian adaptation.

# 20-topic-brainstorm

## Goal

Have students brainstorm brief note-form details that support a given topic sentence.

### Secondary Goals

- Encourage idea generation without strict grammatical structure
- Ensure the notes stay on topic and logically expand on the main idea
- Focus on note-taking format rather than full sentences or polished paragraphs

## How It Works

1. A topic sentence is provided to the student, e.g., “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.”
2. The student must brainstorm supporting details or facts relevant to that topic, but only in note form—no complete sentences required.
3. Grammar is not emphasized unless the text is illegible. The primary focus is on the relevance of the notes and their note-taking style.
4. Feedback highlights how well the notes align with the topic sentence and whether they are concise bullet points rather than fully developed sentences.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Encourage simpler, more direct note phrases. Examples: “improves heart health,” “reduces stress,” “free vitamin D from sunlight.”

### Level 2

Allow for more concept-based or inference-based notes. For instance, “reduces risk of chronic illness,” “opportunity to socialize with friends,” “supports mental health through sunlight exposure.”

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Relevance to the Topic Sentence:
- Each note must clearly connect to or support the main idea of the topic sentence, not stray into unrelated points.

2. Note Form Over Complete Sentences:
- Students should write short bullet points or abbreviated phrases. Full sentences or mini-paragraphs are discouraged, though minor expansions may be allowed if needed.

3. Legibility and Basic Clarity:
- Grammar and mechanics are not a priority unless the result is unreadable or incoherent. The essential requirement is that the note makes sense and relates to the topic.

4. Idea Generation Emphasis:
- The exercise is about brainstorming. Encourage multiple relevant points, not necessarily in polished language.

5. Students should not submit duplicate notes.
- If the student submits duplicate notes, they should be removed. Even if the notes are not identical, if they are very similar, they should be marked as errors.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Writing complete sentences or paragraphs instead of bullet points

Students might revert to standard writing. While not the worst error, it defeats the purpose of note-form brainstorming.

**Example:** Instead of “Boosts mood, helps with stress,” they write “Exercising outdoors can help reduce stress and boost mood because of fresh air.”

### Adding irrelevant details that do not support the topic sentence

Students may include off-topic or tangential notes that don’t relate to the main idea.

**Example:** Topic: “Outdoor exercise” → Irrelevant note: “Indoor gyms have better equipment.” (Not supporting the idea of outdoor benefits)

### Incomprehensible or illegible notes

Even though grammar is not the focus, scribbles or partial words must at least be understandable as phrases supporting the topic.

**Example:** Note: “S rng hret stms in mra” (nonsensical, not interpretable)



## Format Requirements

### Write short note-form details that expand on the topic sentence without drifting off-topic.

**Correct Example:** Topic: “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.” → Notes: “lowers blood pressure,” “vitamin D from sunlight,” “improves mental well-being.”

**Incorrect Example:** Topic: “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.” → Notes: “I prefer to watch movies on the weekend,” “plants need water.” (irrelevant details)

### Avoid full sentences or paragraphs; grammar is not priority.

**Correct Example:** Topic: “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.” → “better mood,” “social connection,” “fresh air vs. stale gym air.”

**Incorrect Example:** Topic: “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.” → “Outdoor exercise has lots of different health benefits, for instance it can reduce stress and improve your cardiovascular endurance significantly.” (long sentence, not note form)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: “Reading regularly improves cognitive function.” → “builds vocabulary,” “enhances focus,” “boosts memory.”"

All notes relate directly to the benefits of reading and are written in concise bullet form without unnecessary grammar.

### Example: "Topic: “Technology helps people stay connected.” → “video calls with distant relatives,” “online collaboration at work,” “real-time messaging on phones.”"

Short, relevant notes supporting how technology facilitates connection, using bullet/phrase style.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: “Outdoor exercise has numerous health benefits.” → Notes: “Once upon a time, I went hiking with my family and it was really fun.”"

This is a full anecdotal sentence, not a concise note. Also focuses on personal story instead of a general benefit or detail in note form.

### Example: "Topic: “Global warming poses serious threats.” → Notes: “sports are important for kids,” “I like to eat ice cream.”"

Completely unrelated to global warming. Fails the relevance requirement, so it is not supporting the topic sentence.



---

# 21-topic-sentence-matching

## Goal

Have students analyze a set of detail sentences and select the ones that support or align with the given topic sentence.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce understanding of how topic sentences introduce main ideas, which are supported by detail sentences
- Promote critical thinking and understanding of content organization
- Develop skills in identifying supporting details and recognizing which statements are relevant to a topic

## How It Works

1. Students are provided with a topic sentence and a set of detail sentences.
2. They must select the sentences that logically support, explain, or elaborate on the topic sentence.
3. The key is ensuring that the selected sentences are relevant and help to clarify or expand on the central idea of the topic sentence.
4. Feedback will highlight if the student correctly identified the detail sentences and explain why those details support the topic sentence.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Start with simple, clear topic sentences and provide straightforward supporting details. Focus on ensuring the student understands the relationship between the topic and supporting details.

### Level 2

Include more complex topic sentences and supporting details. Challenge students to identify subtle connections and relevance between the topic and the supporting details.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Relevance to Topic Sentence:
- Each detail sentence should directly relate to and support the main idea introduced by the topic sentence.

2. Logical Support:
- The selected detail sentences should logically develop or explain the topic. The student should be able to show how each selected sentence aligns with or elaborates on the topic sentence.

3. Elimination of Irrelevant or Off-Topic Sentences:
- Incorrect choices will be identified if the selected sentences do not relate directly to the main idea of the topic sentence. Look for misinterpretation of the topic.

4. Clarifying Comprehension:
- The goal is to help students strengthen their understanding of how topic sentences introduce a central idea and how supporting details elaborate on or prove that idea.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Selecting irrelevant details that do not connect to the topic sentence

Students may select sentences that are too general or unrelated to the topic, either due to misunderstanding the topic or misjudging relevance.

**Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots are smart machines." → Selected detail: "Robots can solve problems." (incorrect) → Reason: This detail does not explain or develop the idea of robots being smart machines.

### Failing to identify all the relevant supporting details

Students may miss some details that logically support the topic sentence or fail to select all that are relevant.

**Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots can help people in many ways." → Missing: "They can perform dangerous tasks, saving lives in hazardous environments." (missing relevant supporting detail)

### Selecting sentences that conflict with or contradict the topic sentence

Students may select sentences that present ideas contrary to the topic sentence or undermine the main idea.

**Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots are smart machines." → Selected detail: "Robots need constant human guidance to perform tasks." (incorrect) → Reason: This contradicts the idea of robots being independent smart machines.



## Format Requirements

### The selected detail sentences must directly relate to and support the main idea introduced by the topic sentence.

**Correct Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots are used in many industries." → Selected details: "Robots work in factories and warehouses." "Robots can assemble cars efficiently."

**Incorrect Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots are used in many industries." → Selected detail: "Robots can solve problems." (too general, not specific to industries).

### Do not select irrelevant sentences that do not support the main idea of the topic sentence.

**Correct Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots help with tasks in healthcare." → Selected detail: "Robots assist doctors in surgeries."

**Incorrect Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots help with tasks in healthcare." → Selected detail: "Robots can solve complex math problems." (irrelevant to healthcare).



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Robots are smart machines." → Selected detail: "Robots can make decisions based on complex algorithms.""

The selected detail directly supports the idea of robots being smart machines by explaining how they process information.

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Robots help in agriculture." → Selected detail: "Robots can plant seeds and harvest crops, improving efficiency.""

The selected detail is relevant to agriculture, explaining how robots contribute to this industry and improving efficiency.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Robots are smart machines." → Selected detail: "Robots can run at high speeds.""

This sentence is too general and does not explain or develop the idea of robots being smart machines.

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Robots assist doctors in surgeries." → Selected detail: "Robots are expensive to maintain.""

This is an irrelevant detail; it doesn’t support the idea of robots assisting doctors in surgeries and is off-topic.

# 21C-identify-ts-and-sequence-details

## Goal

Help students identify topic sentences within paragraphs and determine the correct sequence of supporting details using context clues.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce understanding of topic sentence characteristics (general statements that introduce the main idea)
- Develop skills in recognizing how supporting details expand upon or explain topic sentences
- Practice identifying the logical order of supporting details using context clues and transition words
- Learn to distinguish between broad, introductory statements and more specific, supporting details

## How It Works

1. Students are presented with several sentences drawn from a paragraph, displayed in a shuffled order.
2. Students must identify which sentence is the topic sentence.
3. Students must also arrange the remaining sentences in the correct logical sequence as supporting details.
4. The system evaluates both the topic sentence identification and the sequence of supporting details separately.
5. Feedback focuses on two aspects: (a) identifying characteristics of topic sentences versus supporting details, and (b) using transition words and context clues to determine the proper sequence.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

For younger students, focus on helping them understand the basic difference between topic sentences (general statements) and supporting details (specific examples). Guide them to recognize common transition words that signal sequence (first, next, then, finally) when ordering supporting details.

### Level 2

For older students, focus on helping them understand the basic difference between topic sentences (general statements) and supporting details (specific examples). Guide them to recognize common transition words that signal sequence (first, next, then, finally) when ordering supporting details.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Topic Sentence Identification:
- Topic sentences present broad ideas that the paragraph will develop
- Topic sentences often preview the main concept of the entire paragraph
- Supporting details provide specific examples, facts, or evidence that elaborate on the topic sentence

2. Supporting Detail Sequence:
- Order is determined by transition words (first, next, then, finally, etc.)
- Logical progression of ideas forms a coherent narrative or explanation
- Temporal or spatial relationships between details may indicate proper sequence

3. Feedback Approach:
- When a student misidentifies the topic sentence, explain why their selection is more suitable as a supporting detail
- When a student sequences supporting details incorrectly, highlight transition words or logical connections they missed
- Provide specific guidance on how to improve both aspects of the task

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Selecting a specific example as the topic sentence

Students may choose a detailed fact or specific example instead of the broader statement that introduces the main idea.

**Example:** Topic: "Renewable energy is transforming how we power our world." → Incorrect selection: "Solar panels can reduce electric bills by up to 50%." (too specific to be a topic sentence)

### Mistaking a concluding statement for a topic sentence

Students may select a summarizing or concluding statement rather than the sentence that introduces the main idea.

**Example:** Paragraph about travel experiences → Incorrect selection: "In conclusion, these adventures broaden your perspective." (This is a concluding statement, not the topic sentence.)

### Missing or misinterpreting transition words in supporting details

Students may overlook words like "first," "next," "then," and "finally" that signal the proper sequence of supporting details.

**Example:** Correct sequence: "First, exercise strengthens cardiovascular health. Then, it improves muscle tone. Finally, it enhances mental wellbeing." → Incorrect sequence: placing "Finally" before "Then" disrupts the logical progression.



## Format Requirements

### Students must select exactly one sentence as the topic sentence and arrange the remaining sentences in the correct sequence as supporting details.

**Correct Example:** Topic sentence: "Robots are changing how people work in modern factories." Supporting details in sequence: 1. "They handle repetitive tasks." 2. "They improve precision." 3. "They increase production speed."

**Incorrect Example:** Selecting a specific detail as the topic sentence, such as "Robots in automobile factories can assemble cars faster than human workers," or arranging supporting details in an illogical order that ignores transition words.

### Feedback should specifically address both aspects of the task: topic sentence identification and supporting detail sequencing.

**Correct Example:** Feedback: "Your selected topic sentence focuses on a specific example rather than introducing the main idea. Also, notice that the supporting detail with 'Finally' should come last in the sequence."

**Incorrect Example:** Generic feedback that doesn't distinguish between the two aspects of the task or fails to highlight specific indicators the student missed.



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Many cities are investing in green technology to combat climate change." Supporting details: 1. "They are installing solar panels." 2. "They are creating bike lanes." 3. "They are upgrading public transportation.""

The topic sentence introduces the broad concept that the paragraph explores. The supporting details are correctly sequenced using transition words that signal their order.

### Example: "Topic sentence: "Reading regularly offers numerous benefits to people of all ages." Supporting details: 1. "It expands vocabulary." 2. "It improves concentration." 3. "It reduces stress.""

The topic sentence presents the general idea about reading benefits. The supporting details follow a logical progression with clear transition words indicating their sequence.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Incorrect topic sentence: "For instance, I enjoy mystery novels with complex plots." (in a paragraph about reading benefits)"

This sentence begins with "For instance," clearly marking it as a supporting detail or example, not a topic sentence. It addresses a specific preference rather than introducing the main idea about reading benefits.

### Example: "Incorrect sequence: 3. "Amphibians can adapt to changing environments." 1. "They have permeable skin." 2. "They can live both in water and on land." (in a paragraph about amphibian adaptations)"

This sequence is incorrect. The numbers show the order the student placed them in, but the logical order should be: 1. "They have permeable skin." 2. "They can live both in water and on land." 3. "Amphibians can adapt to changing environments."



---

# 22-eliminate-irrelevant-sentences

## Goal

Have students identify which sentence is the topic sentence and which is irrelevant in a set of sentences about a single topic.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce the function of a topic sentence (introducing the paragraph’s main idea)
- Teach students how supporting detail sentences connect back to the topic sentence
- Help students spot an off-topic or irrelevant sentence that does not serve the paragraph’s main idea
- Provide strong feedback explaining the differences among topic, detail, and irrelevant sentences

## How It Works

1. Students see a list of sentences, one of which is the topic sentence, one is irrelevant, and the others are supporting details.
2. They must identify which sentence is the main topic sentence and which sentence is irrelevant to that topic.
3. Since the correct answers are already known, the system focuses on giving detailed feedback that clarifies why a chosen sentence is or isn’t a topic sentence (too narrow, too specific, or off-topic) and why another sentence is off-topic or irrelevant.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Use clear language that explains why the chosen sentence is or isn’t the topic sentence or irrelevant.

### Level 2

Use clear language that explains why the chosen sentence is or isn’t the topic sentence or irrelevant.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Distinguishing the Topic Sentence:
- The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph, typically broader than the detail sentences.

2. Identifying Supporting Details:
- Supporting detail sentences add examples, evidence, or specifics that relate directly to the topic sentence.

3. Spotting the Irrelevant Sentence:
- The irrelevant sentence does not connect to the main idea or might contradict it, failing to support or elaborate the topic sentence.

4. Feedback Emphasis:
- If a student chooses the wrong topic sentence or irrelevant sentence, the system must explain why that choice doesn’t serve as the main idea or is not truly off-topic, referencing the paragraph’s overall focus.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Choosing a specific supporting sentence as the topic sentence

Students may be drawn to an interesting or detailed sentence but ignore that it does not present the overall main idea.

**Example:** Topic sentence is broad: "Community gardens encourage healthier eating." → A narrower supporting detail: "Volunteers often manage individual garden plots on weekends." (too specific to be the topic sentence)

### Missing the irrelevant sentence because it seems superficially related

The sentence might mention a similar concept or use shared vocabulary but ultimately does not support the main topic or goes off in a different direction.

**Example:** Main topic: "Community gardens," Irrelevant sentence: "Decorative houseplants require specialized indoor care." (talks about plants, but not about community gardens)

### Marking a valid supporting detail as irrelevant

Some students might label a correct supporting detail as irrelevant if they fail to see how it expands on the topic sentence.

**Example:** Topic: "Community gardens boost neighborhood morale." → Detail: "Neighbors meet regularly to share tips and harvest produce together." (this is relevant, not irrelevant)



## Format Requirements

### Students must select exactly one topic sentence and exactly one irrelevant sentence. The remaining are supporting details.

**Correct Example:** Topic: "Electric cars are becoming more popular." → Irrelevant: "Research shows it’s best to use public transport in crowded cities." → Supporting details: Facts about cost, charging stations, environmental impact, etc.

**Incorrect Example:** Selecting no irrelevant sentences or multiple topic sentences, or labeling a correct detail as irrelevant.

### Provide instructive feedback if the student misidentifies the topic sentence or irrelevant sentence, explaining how each sentence relates (or doesn’t) to the central idea.

**Correct Example:** Feedback: "You chose a sentence that focuses on a single example as the topic. A real topic sentence is broader, setting the direction for the entire paragraph."

**Incorrect Example:** Feedback that simply says "Wrong" without clarifying the difference between topic, detail, and irrelevant sentence.



## Positive Examples

### Example: "List of sentences about "Exercise improving mental health":
1) "Regular physical activity releases endorphins."
2) "Endorphins help reduce stress and elevate mood."
3) "Exercise improving mental well-being can be achieved through many activities."
4) "Many people enjoy hiking on weekends."

Correct identification:
- Topic sentence: #3
- Irrelevant: #4 (talks about a hobby, but doesn’t tie it directly to mental health)"

#3 clearly states the broad idea: "Exercise improving mental well-being...". #4 is off-topic or too general about a hobby without addressing mental health benefits.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Mistaken choice: selecting #2 as topic sentence and #3 as irrelevant in the example above."

Feedback should clarify that #2 is a specific detail about endorphins, not the overall statement about exercise and mental health. #3, ironically, is the broad statement linking exercise to mental well-being, so it is not irrelevant.



---

# 26-use-three-strategies

## Goal

Help students improve their writing by learning to transform boring topic sentences into more engaging ones using specific strategies.

### Secondary Goals

- Practice using different sentence types effectively
- Learn to use appositives to add descriptive detail
- Master subordinating conjunctions to show relationships between ideas
- Develop understanding of sentence variety in writing
- Build confidence in revising and improving sentences
- Encourage original thinking and creative sentence construction

## How It Works

Students are given:
1. A topic sentence that is factually correct but boring
2. A specific strategy to use for improvement
3. Example improvements using that strategy

They must then:
1. Write a new, improved version of the topic sentence
2. Apply the assigned strategy correctly
3. Create an original sentence, not copy or closely mimic the examples

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept simpler improvements that show basic understanding of the strategy
Focus on whether the strategy is recognizably applied
Be lenient with grammar if the meaning is clear
Value attempts to make the sentence more interesting
Look for basic comprehension of how the strategy works
Does not need to be factually accurate in every detail

### Level 2

Expect more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure
Look for nuanced application of the strategy
Require proper grammar and punctuation
Value creative and effective improvements
When a specific sentence type is assigned, ensure it is used correctly

## Important Principles for Grading

The improved sentence can convey different ideas than the original, but the main topic should be the same
The improved sentence should not directly contradict the original
The assigned improvement strategy must be clearly applied
Grammar should be appropriate for grade level
The submission should not be a copy or close paraphrase of any of the examples
Accept creative approaches that effectively use the strategy
Look for evidence that the student understands how to use the strategy
Some special notes for the strategy of 'Use a specific sentence type':
1. The student only needs to use a SPECIFIC sentence type if the question specifies it.
2. If a specific sentence type is assigned, using the wrong sentence type is a critical error that should always result in marking the submission as incorrect.
3. If the question does not specify a sentence type, the student can use ANY of the four valid sentence types: Declarative, Interrogative, Imperative, Exclamatory
4. It is just fine if the student starts with a declarative sentence and then writes ANOTHER declarative sentence, as long as their submission is more engaging.
5. For 'Use a specific sentence type' questions where the student tries an interrogative, they should avoid cutesy loopholes such as "<some assertion>, isn't it?" and use a question word like "why" or "how" instead

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Copying or closely mimicking examples

Students might try to create "new" sentences by simply replacing words in the examples with synonyms

**Example:** Example: "Since sharks have adapted to life underwater, they can be found in oceans around the world."
Submission: "Since sharks have adapted to life undersea, they can be found in seas around the world."

### Changing core meaning

Student considerably alters the main idea of the original sentence

**Example:** Original: "Dogs make good pets" → "Cats are better than dogs"

### Wrong strategy application

Student uses a different strategy than the one assigned

**Example:** Asked to use appositive but uses a subordinating conjunction instead

### Using the wrong sentence type

When a specific sentence type is requested, student uses a different type; this is a critical error (severity: error)

**Example:** Required: Imperative sentence. Student writes: "The ocean contains many species." (This is a declarative sentence, not imperative)



## Format Requirements

### Must be a complete, grammatical sentence

**Correct Example:** Original: "Dogs make good pets" → "Dogs, our loyal and loving companions, make wonderful family pets."

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "Dogs make good pets" → "Dogs good pets very nice"

### When a specific sentence type is required, the student MUST use that exact sentence type (failure to do so is a critical error with severity "error")

**Correct Example:** Required: Imperative. "Explore the wonders of the ocean to discover fascinating marine life!"

**Incorrect Example:** Required: Imperative. "The ocean contains countless fascinating species." (This is declarative, not imperative)

### For declarative sentences, make a clear statement that uses descriptive language and strong verbs to convey information

**Correct Example:** Original: "Pizza is good" → "Pizza offers a perfect blend of flavors and textures that satisfy any craving."

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "Pizza is good" → "Pizza good food tastes nice people like it"

### For interrogative sentences, use question words (how, why, what) to pose thoughtful questions rather than yes/no questions or statement-with-question-mark patterns. Must end with a question mark.

**Correct Example:** Original: "History is interesting" → "Have you ever wondered how historical events shape our modern world?"

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "History is interesting" → "History is interesting, right?"

### For imperative sentences, start with a verb and give a clear command or direction, ending with an exclamation mark for emphasis. Should usually end with an exclamation mark, but not always.

**Correct Example:** Original: "Exercise is healthy" → "Start your day with a brisk walk to energize your body and mind!"

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "Exercise is healthy" → "You should exercise more."

### For exclamatory sentences, express strong emotion or emphasis using "what" or "how" at the start. Must end with an exclamation mark.

**Correct Example:** Original: "Sunsets are pretty" → "What a spectacular display of colors nature paints across the evening sky!"

**Incorrect Example:** Original: "Sunsets are pretty" → "Sunsets are so pretty!!"



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "Dogs make good pets"
Student's improved sentence: "Dogs provide unconditional love and lifelong companionship to their owners.""

Maintains the declarative sentence type but adds descriptive details and stronger verbs to create a more engaging topic sentence.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "The beach is nice"
Required sentence type: Exclamatory
Student's improved sentence: "What an amazing place the beach is for relaxation and fun!""

Successfully uses exclamatory sentence type as required while maintaining the core meaning and adding descriptive details.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "Reading is good for you"
Required sentence type: Interrogative
Student's improved sentence: "Have you discovered how reading can expand your knowledge and imagination?""

Successfully uses interrogative sentence type as required while enhancing the core message about reading's benefits.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "The Grand Canyon attracts tourists"
Student's improved sentence: "Have you seen how the Grand Canyon, a breathtaking natural wonder, attracts millions of tourists each year?""

Changes the sentence into an interrogative (one of the four valid sentence types) to introduce the topic.

### Example: "Strategy: Use an appositive
Original sentence: "The Grand Canyon attracts tourists"
Student's improved sentence: "The Grand Canyon, a breathtaking natural wonder, attracts millions of tourists each year.""

Maintains core meaning while adding descriptive detail through appositive.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a subordinating conjunction
Original sentence: "Exercise is important"
Student's improved sentence: "Because regular exercise strengthens both body and mind, it plays a crucial role in maintaining health.""

Uses subordinating conjunction to show relationship while expanding the idea.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Strategy: Use a subordinating conjunction
Original sentence: "Sharks live in the ocean"
Example provided to student: "Since sharks have adapted to life underwater, they can be found in oceans around the world."
Student's improved sentence: "Since sharks have developed for life in the ocean, they can be found in seas all around the world.""

The submission is a close copy of the example provided to the student, with just a few words changed.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a subordinating conjunction
Original sentence: "The ocean contains many species"
Student's improved sentence: "The vast ocean contains countless fascinating species.""

Although the sentence is more engaging, it does not use the assigned strategy (should include a subordinating conjunction).

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "The ocean contains many species"
Required sentence type: Imperative
Student's improved sentence: "The vast ocean contains countless fascinating species.""

Although the sentence is more engaging, it does not use the assigned sentence type (should be an imperative sentence).

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "Sunsets are beautiful"
Required sentence type: Interrogative
Student's improved sentence: "The vibrant colors of sunset paint the sky!""

Although the sentence is more descriptive, it uses an exclamatory sentence type instead of the required interrogative type.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "Reading helps you learn"
Required sentence type: Exclamatory
Student's improved sentence: "Open a book and expand your knowledge.""

The student wrote an imperative sentence instead of the required exclamatory sentence type.

### Example: "Strategy: Use a specific sentence type
Original sentence: "Exercise is good for health"
Required sentence type: Declarative
Student's improved sentence: "When will you start your fitness journey?""

The student wrote an interrogative sentence instead of the required declarative sentence type.

# 31-using-transition-words

## Goal

Have students select transition words or phrases that logically connect clauses/sentences, using correct spelling and appropriate formality.

### Secondary Goals

- Reinforce understanding of various transition words and their functions (e.g., cause/effect, contrast, addition, sequence)
- Improve coherence by accurately signaling the relationship between ideas
- Develop awareness of how transitions affect the logical flow between sentences
- Learn to distinguish between formal academic transitions and informal conversational connectors
- Correctly identify and use multiple transitions when a passage requires them

## How It Works

1. Students see a brief passage containing sentences or independent clauses with one or more blanks between them.
2. They must fill in these blanks with transition words or phrases that make logical sense given the meaning of the passage.
3. An optional "core knowledge" accordion can be opened to reveal more context or background information to help guide their choice of transitions.
4. The grader checks whether the selected transitions align semantically with the surrounding text, are spelled correctly, and maintain appropriate formality. Students are ONLY responsible for choosing the transition words or phrases themselves - punctuation and formatting are handled by the exercise.
5. Some passages may require multiple transition words (e.g., "Hence" followed by "Eventually"). In these cases, all transitions must be semantically appropriate and correctly spelled.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on common transitions like "and," "but," "so," "then," "because," or "for example." Ensure the relationship between clauses is straightforward (addition, cause/effect, contrast). If answer is incorrect, focus on explaining clearly what the mistake was and how other transitions would work.

### Level 2

Encourage more nuanced or sophisticated transitions ("however," "moreover," "consequently," "in contrast," "on the other hand"). Students should demonstrate an understanding of subtle meaning differences. If answer is incorrect, focus on explaining clearly what the mistake was and how other transitions would work.

## Important Principles for Grading

1. Logical Fit:
- The transition must decently reflect the relationship between the clauses (e.g., contrast, addition, cause/effect, sequence).
2. Semantic Correctness:
- The transition should make logical sense in the context of the sentences it connects.
3. Formal Appropriateness:
- The transition should be appropriate for academic writing, avoiding overly conversational terms like "anyway," "plus," or "also" when more precise transitions would better establish the relationship.
4. Spelling and Proper Usage:
- Transitions must be spelled correctly and used in their proper form. Misspellings like "Eventualy" instead of "Eventually" should be identified as errors.
- Using a word with the wrong meaning (e.g., "Henceforth" which means "from now on" instead of "Hence" which means "as a result") should be identified as an error.
5. Multiple Transitions (When Applicable):
- When a passage has multiple blanks, EACH transition must be evaluated independently. A correct answer requires ALL transitions to be appropriate, correctly spelled, and properly used.
6. Grading Focus:
- Evaluation should focus only on the student's choice of transition words or phrases, not on punctuation or formatting which are handled by the exercise.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Choosing an incorrect transition that reverses or distorts the intended meaning

Students might pick a phrase like "however" when the sentence suggests a cause-effect relationship better suited to "therefore" or "as a result."

**Example:** Passage: "Kids love trading Pokémon cards. ________, they often swap a Pikachu card for a Charizard card." → Student inputs "Nevertheless" incorrectly.

### Selecting a transition that doesn't match the logical relationship

Students might choose words that don't properly connect the ideas in the sentence pair.

**Example:** Passage: "She studied all night. ________, she failed the test." → Student inputs "Therefore" when "However" or "Nevertheless" would be correct.

### Using informal or conversational transitions that lack precise meaning

Students might use conversational fillers or vague connectors instead of precise transitions that clearly establish the relationship between ideas.

**Example:** Passage: "The experiment produced unexpected results. ________, we need to revise our hypothesis." → Student inputs "Anyway" instead of "Therefore" or "Consequently."

### Misspelling transition words

Students may understand the correct concept but make spelling errors that change the meaning or create confusion.

**Example:** Passage: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late." → Student inputs "Hense" instead of "Hence" or "Therfore" instead of "Therefore".

### Confusing similar transitions with different meanings

Some transitions sound similar but have different meanings and uses.

**Example:** Passage: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late." → Student inputs "Henceforth" (which means "from now on") instead of "Hence" (which means "as a result").

### Missing or incorrectly addressing multiple transitions

When a passage requires more than one transition, students might get one right but miss or misuse others.

**Example:** Passage: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late. ________, he rushed out the door." → Student correctly uses "Hence" for the first blank but incorrectly uses "Evenchually" (misspelled) instead of "Eventually" for the second.



## Format Requirements

### The transition should generally be appropriate to the passage context and establish a logical relationship, though alternative transitions with similar meanings may be acceptable.

**Correct Example:** Passage: "It rained heavily. ________, the fields were flooded." → "Consequently," "Therefore," "As a result," "Because of this," or similar transitions indicating cause-effect are suitable.

**Incorrect Example:** Using "Meanwhile" in this context would be inappropriate as it suggests simultaneous actions rather than cause-effect. Using transitions that completely change the intended meaning of the passage would be considered incorrect.

### All transitions must be spelled correctly and used in their proper form.

**Correct Example:** Passage with multiple transitions: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late. ________, he rushed out the door." → "Hence, he woke up late. Eventually, he rushed out the door."

**Incorrect Example:** Using "Henceforth" (incorrect meaning) or "Eventualy" (misspelled) would be marked incorrect even if one transition is correct.



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Passage: "Kids love trading Pokémon cards. ________, they might swap a Pikachu card for a Charizard card." → Filled with "Therefore," "Hence," "So," "For example," or "In fact.""

This is correct because these transitions indicate either a logical result or provide an illustration of the first statement: Kids love trading, hence they swap specific cards, or as an example of their trading activity.

### Example: "Passage: "I finished my project early. ________, I helped my friend with hers." → Filled with "Afterward," "Then," "Next," or "As a result.""

This is correct because the transition indicates sequence or chronological order between finishing one task and starting another.

### Example: "Passage with multiple transitions: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late. ________, he rushed out the door." → Filled with "Hence" and "Eventually""

This is correct because the first transition ("Hence") shows cause-effect between forgetting the alarm and waking up late. The second transition ("Eventually") shows the time sequence leading to rushing out the door.

### Example: "Passage: "The weather was stormy. ________, we decided to stay indoors." → Filled with "Therefore," "Consequently," or "As a result.""

This is correct because these transitions show a clear cause-effect relationship between the stormy weather and the decision to stay indoors.

### Example: "Passage: "She loves reading novels. ________, she enjoys writing short stories." → Filled with "Also," "Additionally," "Furthermore," or "Moreover.""

This is correct because these transitions indicate addition or extension of a related idea, showing that both reading and writing are activities the person enjoys.

### Example: "Passage: "The road was closed. ________, we found another route." → Filled with "However," "Nevertheless," or "Even so.""

This is correct because these transitions signal contrast between the problem (closed road) and the solution (finding another route), showing how the second action overcame the obstacle presented in the first statement.

### Example: "Passage with multiple transitions: "________, gather all ingredients. ________, preheat the oven to 350 degrees." → Filled with "First" and "Next" or "Then""

This is correct because the transitions establish a clear sequence of steps in the cooking process, with "First" indicating the initial step and "Next" or "Then" showing the subsequent action.

### Example: "Passage: "The team worked through the night. ________, they finished the project on time." → Filled with "Consequently" instead of "Therefore""

This is correct because although "Therefore" was the expected transition word, "Consequently" is also an appropriate cause-and-effect transition that fits the context. Both words effectively show the relationship between working through the night and finishing on time.

### Example: "Passage: "She studied for weeks. ________, she passed the exam." → Filled with "Thus" instead of "As a result""

This is correct because even though "As a result" was the target transition, "Thus" is an acceptable alternative that maintains the cause-and-effect relationship between studying and passing the exam. Different transitions within the same category can often be used interchangeably.

### Example: "Passage: "The road was closed. ________, we found another route." → Filled with "Still" instead of "However""

This is correct because while "Still" is less formal than "However," it adequately conveys the contrast between the problem and solution. The meaning is preserved even though the word choice is not the most precise for academic writing.

### Example: "Passage: "I love hiking in the mountains. ________, I enjoy swimming in lakes." → Filled with "Plus" instead of "Additionally""

This is correct because although "Plus" is more conversational than "Additionally" or "Furthermore," it still successfully communicates the additive relationship between the two outdoor activities the person enjoys. The informal tone does not change the logical connection being expressed.

### Example: "Passage: "The mountain trail was steep. ________, they reached the summit. Then, they took photos of the view." → Filled with "Nevertheless" or "Nonetheless""

This is correct because these transitions show contrast between the steepness of the trail and their success in reaching the summit. Words like "Nevertheless" and "Nonetheless" indicate that something happened despite a difficulty or obstacle, which fits the relationship between the sentences perfectly.

### Example: "Passage: "She practiced every day. ________, she improved her skills significantly." → Filled with "As a result" or "Consequently""

This is correct because these transitions establish a clear cause-effect relationship between daily practice and skill improvement. The transition words effectively show that the improvement was a direct result of the consistent practice.

### Example: "Passage: "________, we reviewed the material. ________, we took the exam." → Filled with "First" and "Afterward" or "Subsequently""

This is correct because these transitions create a logical time sequence. "First" indicates the initial action in the process, while "Afterward" or "Subsequently" shows that the exam followed the review session, establishing a clear chronological order of events.

### Example: "Passage: "The rain stopped. ________, the sun came out." → Filled with "Soon after" or "Shortly thereafter""

This is correct because these time-sequence transitions accurately indicate that one event followed another after a brief interval. They establish the temporal relationship between the end of the rain and the appearance of the sun.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Passage: "I finished my project early. ________, I helped my friend with hers." → Filled with "However" or "On the other hand""

This is incorrect because these transitions signal contrast, but there's no contrast here; the second sentence logically follows as a supportive action, not a contradictory or contrasting idea.

### Example: "Passage: "The research findings were significant. ________, we published our paper in a top journal." → Filled with "Anyway" or "Plus""

This is incorrect because "Anyway" is too informal and typically used to return to a topic after a digression. "Plus" is also conversational. Better transitions would be "Consequently," "Therefore," or "As a result" to show the cause-effect relationship.

### Example: "Passage with multiple transitions: "He forgot to set an alarm. ________, he woke up late. ________, he rushed out the door." → Filled with "Henceforth" and "Evenchually""

This is incorrect because both transitions are problematic. "Henceforth" means "from now on" which doesn't fit the cause-effect relationship needed. "Evenchually" is misspelled (should be "Eventually"). Both transitions must be correct for the answer to be fully correct.

# 32-finishing-transition-words

## Goal

Help students develop the ability to connect ideas logically using transition words while maintaining topic coherence.

### Secondary Goals

- Practice using different types of transitions (time/sequence, conclusion, illustration, etc.)
- Learn to maintain topic coherence across sentences
- Develop understanding of cause-effect, contrast, and other logical relationships
- Master proper punctuation with transition words
- Use provided context to write relevant and informed transitions

## How It Works

The student is given:
  1. An initial sentence to transition from
  2. A required transition word to start their new sentence
  3. Optional background information or context about the topic
  4. Sometimes, an optional second transition word they may use

The student must write a new sentence that:
  1. Begins with the given transition word
  2. Follows logically from the first sentence
  3. Maintains the same topic
  4. Uses the transition word appropriately for its type
  5. Incorporates any provided background context appropriately

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on basic transitions like "first," "next," "then," and "finally." Expect simple but clear connections between ideas. Use background context that is grade-appropriate.

### Level 2

Work with more sophisticated transitions like "furthermore," "consequently," and "in contrast." Expect more nuanced relationships between ideas and better integration of provided context.

## Important Principles for Grading

The transition word must be used at the start of the second sentence
The second sentence must maintain the same topic as the first
The relationship between sentences must match the purpose of the transition word (e.g., "however" shows contrast)
The second sentence must be grammatically complete and correct
The connection between sentences must be logical and clear
If background context is provided, the response should demonstrate understanding of that context
If a second transition word is provided, its use is optional but must be correct if used
The student has no control over the first sentence or the transition word, so don't penalize them for the first sentence or transition word. Only grade whether they used the transition word correctly.
Be lenient on the transition word if the student uses it generally correctly, even if it is not in the exact form you expected.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Topic drift

Writing a second sentence that changes to an unrelated topic or ignores provided context

**Example:** "The museum had many Egyptian artifacts. Furthermore, I like to play soccer."



## Format Requirements

### Start the second sentence with the given transition word

**Correct Example:** "It was raining. Therefore, the game was cancelled."

**Incorrect Example:** "It was raining. The game was therefore cancelled."



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Context: "Cities are improving public transport." First: "The city increased bus service."
Student submitted: "As a result, more people used public transportation.""

Shows clear cause-effect relationship, maintains topic, uses context, and has correct punctuation.

### Example: "Context: "Ancient Egypt built many monuments." First: "Ancient Egypt was a powerful civilization."
Student submitted: "For example, they built massive pyramids as tombs for their pharaohs.""

Uses illustration transition correctly and incorporates background context effectively.

### Example: "Context: "She practiced daily and mastered difficult techniques. She received praise from her instructors." First: "The young pianist showed remarkable talent at the recital."
Student submitted: "On the other hand, her confidence wavered when performing in front of large audiences.""

Uses contrast transition correctly to show a difference between talent and confidence, maintains the topic of the pianist, and connects logically to the context provided. Although there may be better transition words, the student doesn't actually have control of the transition word, so this works in this context.

### Example: "Context: "Ice cream melts in hot weather. It changes from solid to liquid." First: "We left the ice cream outside on a sunny day."
Student submitted: "Consequently, it melted into a puddle.""

Uses cause-effect transition correctly to show what happened to the ice cream because of the heat, stays on topic, and connects to the context about melting.

### Example: "Context: "Plants need water and sunlight to grow. They use these to make food." First: "My garden gets lots of rain."
Student submitted: "Moreover, the sunny spot helps my flowers grow tall.""

Uses addition transition correctly to add another helpful condition for plant growth, stays on the topic of gardening, and connects to the context about what plants need.

### Example: "Context: "Brushing teeth prevents cavities. Toothpaste helps clean away food." First: "I brush my teeth every morning and night."
Student submitted: "Therefore, my dentist says I have healthy teeth.""

Uses the "therefore" transition correctly to show the result of good tooth brushing habits, stays on topic, and makes a logical connection that younger students can understand.

### Example: "Context: "Exercise strengthens muscles and bones. Regular activity improves health." First: "She worked out three times a week."
Student submitted: "Therefore, she became stronger.""

Uses the "therefore" transition correctly to show the logical result of regular exercise, stays on topic, and makes a clear cause-effect connection.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Context: "Computers need regular maintenance." First: "The computer crashed."
Student submitted: "In addition my dog is brown.""

Changes topic completely, ignores context, and lacks required comma after transition.

### Example: "Context: "Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis." First: "The sun provides energy."
Student submitted: "Nevertheless, plants need sunlight to grow.""

Uses contrast transition when the ideas are actually related/supporting and contradicts the context.

# 34-distinguish-g-s-t

## Goal

Help students identify and differentiate between general, specific, and thesis statements, which is crucial for writing well-structured essay introductions and conclusions.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop understanding of how essay introductions are structured
- Learn to create a logical progression from broad to focused statements
- Recognize the role of different statement types in academic writing
- Build skills for writing effective introductory and concluding paragraphs
- Prepare students for multi-paragraph writing tasks

## How It Works

This activity follows a structured process:
1. Students are presented with three statements about a topic
2. They must correctly categorize each statement as either:
   - A general statement (broad context)
   - A specific statement (narrowed focus)
   - A thesis statement (main argument/claim)

The goal is to help students recognize the progression from general to specific to thesis statements used in well-structured essays.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on more obvious distinctions between statement types
Use simpler vocabulary and sentence structures
Provide clear contextual clues to help with categorization
Choose topics familiar to younger students
Use more straightforward examples of each statement type

### Level 2

Expect recognition of more nuanced statements
Use more sophisticated sentence structures and academic vocabulary
Include statements that require deeper analysis to categorize correctly
Choose more complex academic topics
Expect understanding of how these statements would function in larger compositions

## Important Principles for Grading

General statements are broad and introduce universal ideas - they set the stage
Specific statements narrow the focus with particular details or examples - they build context
Thesis statements present the main argument that would be supported in an essay - they make a claim
Help students understand that writing progresses from broad to focused ideas
Focus feedback on the specific characteristics the student missed in their categorization
Provide encouraging feedback that helps them recognize each statement type next time
When a statement is off-topic, note this while still evaluating its structure

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Confusing specific statements with thesis statements

Students may think specific statements are thesis statements when they include concrete details

**Example:** A specific statement about Nelson Mandela's leadership might be mistaken for a thesis

### Mistaking general statements for thesis statements

Students might confuse broad claims with thesis statements

**Example:** A general statement about athletic impact might be mistaken for a thesis

### Confusing general and specific statements

Students often struggle to distinguish between levels of generality

**Example:** Mixing up statements about books in general versus specific literary works

### Not recognizing off-topic statements

Students may not notice when a statement is unrelated to the main topic

**Example:** Missing that a statement about energy doesn't relate to the literary topic



## Format Requirements

### General statements introduce broad concepts

**Correct Example:** "Throughout history, leaders have shaped societies in profound ways."

**Incorrect Example:** "Nelson Mandela fought against apartheid." (too specific)

### Specific statements provide particular details or examples

**Correct Example:** "Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison before becoming South Africa's president."

**Incorrect Example:** "Important people change the world." (too general)

### Thesis statements present a central argument or main claim

**Correct Example:** "Mandela's approach to reconciliation offers valuable lessons for modern political conflicts."

**Incorrect Example:** "Nelson Mandela was from South Africa." (states a fact without making an argument)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Environmental Conservation"
Statements:
- "Environmental issues affect communities worldwide." (General)
- "Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures." (Specific)
- "Immediate climate action is necessary to prevent irreversible ecosystem damage." (Thesis)"

The general statement introduces the broad topic. The specific statement narrows to a particular environmental concern. The thesis statement presents a clear argument about climate action.

### Example: "Topic: "Digital Technology"
Statements:
- "Technology has transformed modern communication." (General)
- "Social media platforms have changed how teenagers interact with their peers." (Specific)
- "Despite its benefits, excessive social media use harms adolescent mental health and should be monitored by parents." (Thesis)"

The general statement makes a broad claim about technology. The specific statement narrows to social media's impact on teens. The thesis statement presents an argument about monitoring social media use.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: "American Civil War"
Incorrect categorizations:
- "The Civil War lasted from 1861 to 1865." (Categorized as General instead of Specific)
- "Wars throughout history have divided nations." (Categorized as Specific instead of General)
- "The Civil War had economic and social effects." (Categorized as Specific instead of Thesis)"

The first statement contains specific dates (specific). The second statement makes a broad observation about all wars (general). The third statement presents a main idea that would be developed in an essay (thesis).



---

# 35-write-s-from-g-t

## Goal

Help students learn to create statements that effectively connect general statements to thesis statements in essay writing.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop skills for writing structured introductory paragraphs
- Practice narrowing broad ideas to more focused contexts
- Learn to connect broad concepts to specific arguments
- Understand the GST paragraph structure
- Build coherent transitions between ideas

## How It Works

Students are given two key components of an introductory paragraph:
1. A general statement (G) that introduces a broad concept or universal idea
2. A thesis statement (T) that presents the main argument or claim of the essay

The student must write a specific statement (S) that connects these two, creating a progression from broad to focused ideas.

This specific statement should:
- Narrow the focus from the general statement
- Provide context for the thesis statement that follows
- Include some details related to the topic
- Create a transition between G and T

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept straightforward specific statements that show an attempt to connect G and T. Focus on basic relationships and clarity of expression.

### Level 2

Look for more developed specific statements that demonstrate understanding of the topic. Appreciate thoughtful transitions and relevant details.

## Important Principles for Grading

The specific statement should help narrow the focus from the general statement
It should provide some relevant details or context related to the topic
It should create a logical connection to the thesis statement
The specific statement should be a complete sentence
It should add new information beyond what's in the general or thesis statement
Consider the underlying concepts and themes, not just terminology - connections can be conceptual without using the exact same words
Be lenient with relevant connections - students may express connections through related concepts, different wording, or implied relationships
Focus on the student's demonstration of understanding the relationship between ideas rather than specific word choice

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Statement remains too general

The specific statement doesn't add enough focus or detail to move from the general statement toward the thesis

**Example:** General: "Books have influenced societies throughout history."
Specific (too general): "Many books have been important."
Thesis: "To Kill a Mockingbird changed American views on racial justice."

### Unclear connection

The specific statement is related to the topic but doesn't clearly connect to both G and T

**Example:** General: "Technology has transformed modern life."
Specific (unclear connection): "Many people enjoy watching movies."
Thesis: "Social media platforms have fundamentally changed how teenagers socialize."

### Mostly repeating G or T

The specific statement mostly restates information from G or T instead of adding new information

**Example:** General: "Exercise is important for health."
Specific (repeating): "Physical activity is crucial for wellness."
Thesis: "Regular cardio workouts significantly reduce the risk of heart disease."



## Format Requirements

### The specific statement should be a complete sentence

**Correct Example:** General: "Space exploration has fascinated humanity for centuries."
Specific: "The Apollo moon landing in 1969 represented a pivotal achievement in human innovation."
Thesis: "Modern space programs like SpaceX are revolutionizing our approach to interplanetary travel."

**Incorrect Example:** General: "Space exploration has fascinated humanity for centuries."
Specific: "the moon landing and other achievements." (fragment)

### The specific statement should add some detail or focus to the topic

**Correct Example:** General: "Natural disasters occur worldwide."
Specific: "Hurricanes in the Caribbean have become more destructive in recent years."
Thesis: "Climate change is directly contributing to the increased intensity of tropical storms."

**Incorrect Example:** General: "Natural disasters occur worldwide."
Specific: "Many types of natural events happen in different places." (lacks detail)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Environmental Conservation"
General: "Environmental issues affect communities worldwide."
Specific: "Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures."
Thesis: "Immediate climate action is necessary to prevent irreversible ecosystem damage.""

This specific statement narrows to a particular environmental issue (coral reefs) and provides a connection to the thesis about climate action. It adds relevant detail while maintaining flow.

### Example: "Topic: "American Literature"
General: "Literature often reflects societal values and concerns."
Specific: "Mark Twain's novels explored the moral issues of post-Civil War America."
Thesis: "Through his use of vernacular language and morally ambiguous characters, Twain created a uniquely American literary voice that challenged conventional thinking.""

This specific statement narrows to a particular author and time period, providing context for the thesis about Twain's techniques. It connects the general idea about literature to the specific argument about Twain.

### Example: "Topic: "Genetic Engineering"
General: "Advancements in genetic engineering open new possibilities in medicine and agriculture."
Specific: "While genetically modified crops can improve yields, rigorous testing and oversight protect both consumers and the environment."
Thesis: "Strict ethical guidelines are needed to ensure that these innovations benefit society without compromising safety.""

This specific statement narrows to genetically modified crops and introduces concepts of testing and oversight, which relate to the ethical guidelines mentioned in the thesis. It connects the general concept to the specific argument about safety and guidelines.

### Example: "Topic: "Technological Change"
General: "Technology continues to transform industries worldwide."
Specific: "Workers who learn new technical skills adapt more successfully to changing job requirements."
Thesis: "Educational programs that teach adaptability are essential for workforce development in the digital age.""

This specific statement narrows from technology in general to how workers respond to technological change. It introduces the concept of learning new skills, which connects to the educational programs mentioned in the thesis.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Digital Technology"
General: "Technology has transformed modern communication."
Specific (needs improvement): "People use many different devices today."
Thesis: "Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how teenagers form and maintain friendships.""

This specific statement is too general. It could be improved by mentioning communication devices specifically or introducing the concept of social media to better connect with the thesis.

### Example: "Topic: "Space Exploration"
General: "Humanity has always been fascinated by the stars."
Specific (needs improvement): "The James Webb Space Telescope uses infrared technology with a 6.5-meter primary mirror consisting of 18 hexagonal gold-plated beryllium segments, and operates at the L2 Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometers from Earth."
Thesis: "Modern space telescopes are revolutionizing our understanding of the early universe.""

This specific statement provides too much technical detail. A more effective statement might mention space telescopes more generally and how they help us study the universe.

# 36-write-g-s-from-t

## Goal

Help students craft effective general and specific statements that precede and support a thesis in essay introductions.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop skills for writing structured introductory paragraphs
- Practice developing broad context before narrowing to specific points
- Learn to create logical progression from general to specific to thesis statements

## How It Works

Students are given a thesis statement (T) that presents the main argument of an essay.
Students must write two statements to effectively introduce this thesis:
1. A general statement (G) that introduces a broad concept related to the thesis topic
2. A specific statement (S) that narrows the focus and connects to the thesis
Together, these statements should form a coherent paragraph with a logical flow.

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept straightforward progression with clear connections. Focus on basic organization and logical flow.

### Level 2

Expect more sophisticated statements that create nuanced connections with appropriate academic tone.

## Important Principles for Grading

Focus on overall coherence and flow - do the statements work well together with the thesis?
The general statement should introduce a broad topic or concept related to the thesis
The specific statement should narrow the focus and build a bridge to the thesis
Accept a wide range of approaches and phrasing - there are many valid ways to introduce a thesis
Be generous with different terminology that expresses the same concept
If statements create a readable, logical progression to the thesis, err on the side of marking correct
Look for whether the student understood the purpose of G-S-T structure rather than exact wording
Prioritize conceptual bridges over precise terminology

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Illogical progression

The statements fail to create a logical flow from general to specific to thesis

**Example:** Thesis: "Electric vehicles are necessary to combat climate change."
General: "Cars are convenient for transportation."
Specific: "Hurricane damage costs billions each year."

### Direct thesis restatement

Simply repeating the thesis in different words rather than providing context

**Example:** Thesis: "Regular exercise improves mental health."
General: "Exercise is good for your brain." (essentially repeats thesis)
Specific: "Working out helps your mood." (essentially repeats thesis)

### Too disconnected

Statements that have no clear relationship to the thesis or each other

**Example:** Thesis: "Social media affects teenage relationships."
General: "Technology changes rapidly."
Specific: "Teenagers spend time on various activities." (neither statement effectively connects to social media or relationships)



## Format Requirements

### Both statements must be complete, grammatically correct sentences

**Correct Example:** General: "Throughout history, humans have sought to understand the cosmos."
Specific: "The invention of the telescope revolutionized astronomical observation."
Thesis: "Modern space telescopes are uncovering unprecedented details about the early universe."

**Incorrect Example:** General: "space and stars." (fragment)
Specific: "telescopes looking at galaxies." (fragment)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Environmental Conservation"
Thesis: "Immediate climate action is necessary to prevent irreversible ecosystem damage."
General: "Environmental issues affect communities worldwide in increasingly severe ways."
Specific: "Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures.""

The general statement introduces the broad topic of environmental issues. The specific statement narrows to a concrete example that relates to the thesis. Together they create a logical progression.

### Example: "Topic: "Astronomy"
Thesis: "Stars not only light up our skies but also help us understand the mysteries of space."
General: "The stars in the night sky have fascinated people for centuries."
Specific: "They were the basis of ancient mythologies, and in more recent centuries stars have been key to our growing scientific knowledge beyond Earth.""

The general statement introduces human fascination with stars. The specific statement connects to scientific knowledge, which is conceptually equivalent to "understanding space mysteries." It builds a logical bridge to the thesis without repeating its exact wording.

### Example: "Topic: "Digital Technology"
Thesis: "Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how teenagers form relationships."
General: "The digital age has transformed how people connect with one another."
Specific: "Young people increasingly use online platforms to establish and maintain their social circles.""

The general statement introduces the broad concept of digital connection. The specific statement narrows to online platforms (conceptually equivalent to social media) and social relationships among young people (addressing the thesis focus on teenagers and relationships).



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Education Reform"
Thesis: "Project-based learning improves student engagement and practical skill development."
General (poor): "Project-based learning is very important in schools."
Specific (poor): "Project-based learning helps students be more engaged and learn practical skills.""

Both statements essentially repeat the thesis instead of providing broader context and then narrowing. The general statement should introduce education approaches broadly, while the specific should provide concrete examples that lead to the thesis.

# 38-write-introductory-sentences

## Goal

Help students learn to create statements that effectively connect general statements to thesis statements in essay writing.

### Secondary Goals

- Develop skills for writing structured introductory paragraphs
- Practice narrowing broad ideas to more focused contexts
- Learn to connect broad concepts to specific arguments
- Understand the GST paragraph structure
- Build coherent transitions between ideas

## How It Works

The student is given the structure of a minimal introductory paragraph to an essay. This paragraph includes:
  1. A general sentence (G)
  2. A specific sentence (S1)
  3. And a thesis statement (T)

The student must write new followup specific statement(s) (S2, S3, etc.) that:
  1. Add some detail to the introductory paragraph
  2. Are somewhat more specific than the general sentence (G)
  3. Are not identical to the first specific sentence (S1)
  4. Help create flow from the general sentence (G) to the thesis statement (T)

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Accept any reasonable specific statements that show an attempt to connect G and T. Focus on basic relationships and clarity of expression.

### Level 2

Look for somewhat developed specific statements that show understanding of the topic. Appreciate attempts at transitions and relevant details.

## Important Principles for Grading

They should provide some details or context related to the topic.
They should build on the first specific statement (S1) rather than just repeat it exactly.
Each specific statement should be a complete sentence.
Consider the underlying concepts and themes very broadly - connections can be conceptual without using similar words.
Be very lenient with relevant connections - students may express connections through related concepts, different wording, or implied relationships.
Focus on the student's basic understanding of relationships between ideas rather than specific word choice.
Clear connections do not require restating G, S1, or T at all; any logical progression that moves toward T is acceptable.
Be very lenient on what qualifies as a "clear connection" - many valid specific statements will not directly connect to G, S1, or T, but will still be appropriate if they generally help flow from G to T.

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Additional specific statement remains very general

The new statement doesn't add much focus or detail to build on the first specific statement or move toward the thesis

**Example:** General: "Books have influenced societies throughout history."
Specific #1: "Classic literature has shaped cultural values."
Specific #2 (too general): "Many books have been important."
Thesis: "To Kill a Mockingbird changed American views on racial justice."

### Very unclear connection

A new statement is somewhat related to the topic but doesn't clearly connect to both G and T or build on S1

**Example:** General: "Technology has transformed modern life."
Specific #1: "Smartphones have revolutionized how we communicate."
Specific #2 (unclear connection): "Many people enjoy watching movies."
Thesis: "Social media platforms have fundamentally changed how teenagers socialize."

### Exactly repeating G or T or the first specific statement (S1)

The specific statement exactly restates information from G or T or the first specific statement (S1) instead of adding anything new

**Example:** General: "Technology has revolutionized modern communication."
Specific #1: "Social media platforms have changed how people interact."
Specific #2 (repeating): "Technology has changed the way we communicate with others."
Thesis: "Facebook and Twitter have fundamentally altered how people maintain friendships."



## Format Requirements

### Any additional specific statements (S2, S3, etc.) should be complete sentences

**Correct Example:** General: "Space exploration has fascinated humanity for centuries."
Specific #1: "The Apollo moon landing in 1969 represented a pivotal achievement in human innovation."
Specific #2: "NASA's subsequent robotic missions to Mars have revealed crucial insights about potential human colonization."
Thesis: "Modern space programs like SpaceX are revolutionizing our approach to interplanetary travel."

**Incorrect Example:** General: "Space exploration has fascinated humanity for centuries."
Specific #1: "The Apollo moon landing changed space travel forever."
Specific #2: "just sending robots to other planets." (fragment)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Environmental Conservation"
General: "Environmental issues affect communities worldwide."
Specific #1: "Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures."
Specific #2: "Coastal communities are introducing coral restoration projects to counteract these effects."
Thesis: "Immediate climate action is necessary to prevent irreversible ecosystem damage.""

These statements show a progression from a broad topic of global environmental issues, to the specific problem of coral reef bleaching, and then highlight localized conservation efforts leading into the thesis on climate action. Each step adds some information and builds a connection toward the need for broader solutions.

### Example: "Topic: "American Literature"
General: "Literature often reflects societal values and concerns."
Specific #1: "Mark Twain's novels explored the moral issues of post-Civil War America."
Specific #2: "He also used satire to critique social norms, revealing the pervasive prejudices of his time."
Thesis: "Through his use of vernacular language and morally ambiguous characters, Twain created a uniquely American literary voice that challenged conventional thinking.""

These two specific statements build from a general observation about literature's role in society, to Twain's focus on moral issues, and then highlight his satirical approach. This progression helps connect the general idea to the thesis on how Twain challenged conventional thinking.

### Example: "Topic: "Genetic Engineering"
General: "Advancements in genetic engineering open new possibilities in medicine and agriculture."
Specific #1: "While genetically modified crops can improve yields, rigorous testing and oversight protect both consumers and the environment."
Specific #2: "Cutting-edge gene editing methods like CRISPR enable targeted therapies for inherited diseases, raising important ethical considerations."
Thesis: "Strict ethical guidelines are needed to ensure that these innovations benefit society without compromising safety.""

This example includes two distinct specific statements, one about genetically modified crops and one about medical applications of gene editing. Both statements relate to testing, oversight, and ethical standards, which helps connect to the thesis.

### Example: "Topic: "Technological Change"
General: "Technology continues to transform industries worldwide."
Specific #1: "As industries evolve, workers who master emerging technologies gain a competitive edge and adapt more readily to shifting job demands."
Specific #2: "Business leaders who foster continuous learning encourage innovation and help employees keep pace with emerging trends."
Thesis: "Educational programs that teach adaptability are essential for workforce development in the digital age.""

The first specific statement discusses how workers benefit from mastering new technologies, while the second talks about leadership promoting learning. These points help set up the thesis about the need for adaptability through education in our digital world.

### Example: "Topic: "Renewable Energy"
General: "The world is shifting toward sustainable energy sources."
Specific #1: "Solar panel installations have increased dramatically in the past decade."
Specific #2: "Wind farms are also becoming more common in many countries."
Thesis: "Renewable energy sources will play a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions.""

While straightforward, the second specific statement adds another example of renewable energy adoption, helping bridge between the general trend and the thesis about reducing emissions.

### Example: "Topic: "Exercise Benefits"
General: "Regular exercise provides many health benefits."
Specific #1: "Studies show that 30 minutes of daily walking can improve heart health."
Specific #2: "Regular exercise also helps reduce stress and anxiety."
Thesis: "Making time for physical activity should be a priority for maintaining both physical and mental wellbeing.""

The second specific statement is simple but effective - it introduces the mental health aspect that connects to the thesis while building on the first specific statement about physical benefits.

### Example: "Topic: "Online Learning"
General: "Education has changed significantly in recent years."
Specific #1: "Many universities now offer fully online degree programs."
Specific #2: "Students can access course materials anytime from anywhere."
Thesis: "Digital learning platforms have made education more accessible and flexible than ever before.""

The second specific statement uses simple language to highlight a key benefit of online learning, helping connect the first specific statement about programs to the thesis about accessibility.



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Topic: "Digital Technology"
General: "Technology has transformed modern communication."
Specific #1 (correct): "Smartphones have enabled instant messaging and video calls, connecting users globally in real time."
Specific #2 (needs improvement): "People use many different devices today."
Thesis: "Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how teenagers form and maintain friendships.""

While the first specific statement talks about smartphones and global communication, the second is too general and could say more about social media's role in teenagers' interactions. Adding some detail about how devices relate to social media would help.

### Example: "Topic: "Space Exploration"
General: "Humanity has always been fascinated by the stars."
Specific #1 (correct): "Modern telescopes allow us to detect exoplanets orbiting distant stars, expanding our search for life in the universe."
Specific #2 (needs improvement): "The James Webb Space Telescope uses infrared technology with a 6.5-meter primary mirror consisting of 18 hexagonal gold-plated beryllium segments, and operates at the L2 Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometers from Earth."
Thesis: "Modern space telescopes are revolutionizing our understanding of the early universe.""

The first statement connects to how telescopes help search for extraterrestrial life. The second statement has lots of technical facts but could better show how these capabilities help us understand the early universe. Mentioning how infrared imaging reveals distant cosmic phenomena would help connect to the thesis.

# 120-identify-keywords

## Goal

Help students identify and select key phrases that carry the main ideas in a sentence

### Secondary Goals

- Develop ability to distinguish essential from non-essential information
- Practice identifying complete meaningful phrases rather than isolated words
- Build skills for effective note-taking and summarization
- Improve reading comprehension through focus on main ideas

## How It Works

This activity follows a two-step process:
1. Students read the sentence and identify key words and phrases
2. Students select the complete key phrases that carry the main ideas

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on simple subject-verb combinations and basic descriptive phrases. Key phrases should be concrete and clearly identifiable.

### Level 2

Look for more complex phrases including abstract concepts, technical terms, and sophisticated combinations of descriptive elements.

## Important Principles for Grading

Phrases that carry main ideas should be selected
Selected phrases should preserve the core meaning of the sentence
There are multiple correct approaches to selecting key phrases in a sentence
The grader should primarily check if selections match or closely align with the phrases in Reasonable keyword selections
Feedback should directly compare student selections to the Reasonable keyword selections list, pointing out specific missing or extra words
When a student omits a key phrase entirely, feedback should explicitly note this missing phrase
Do NOT focus feedback on parts of the sentence that are not included in Reasonable keyword selections (e.g., subjects or verbs if they are not in Reasonable keyword selections)
It is acceptable to split up related phrases into separate selections
Minor adjectives and adverbs can be included or omitted when they don't substantially change meaning
Verbs are not always required if the key concepts are still clear
Action verbs (like "thundered", "jumped", "exploded") can be included or omitted as they are not essential to the key noun phrases
Focus feedback on matching the key phrases listed in Reasonable keyword selections rather than every possible phrase in the sentence
Do NOT merge separate key phrases by including connecting words between them
Do NOT include connecting verbs (like "affect", "is", "have") between key phrases
Do NOT include conjunctions like "and", "or", "but" when they connect distinct concepts
Do NOT include articles like "a", "an", "the" unless they are essential to meaning
When items in a list are connected with conjunctions (e.g., "patience and active listening skills"), select them as separate key phrases
Do NOT omit defining adjectives that significantly change the meaning (e.g., "new" in "new software", "skilled" in "skilled pilots")
When the Reasonable keyword selections example includes a descriptive adjective, it should generally be included in the selection
All descriptive words present in Reasonable keyword selections should be included in student selections

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Including articles

Students frequently select articles that don't carry any meaning. Adjectives, Adverbs, Prepositions and other connecting words are usually ok though.

**Example:** Sentence: The skilled artists create beautiful paintings. Keywords: The skilled artists, paintings (Incorrect, includes the)

### Merging separate key phrases

Students combine distinct key concepts or phrases by including the connecting words between them

**Example:** Sentence: The book requires patience and focus to understand. Keywords: "patience and focus" (Incorrect, should be "patience", "focus" as separate selections)

### Including non-essential connecting words

Students include words like "and", "or", "but", "a", "an", "the" that connect key phrases but don't carry main ideas

**Example:** Sentence: The chef needs fresh ingredients and proper tools. Keywords: "fresh ingredients and proper tools" (Incorrect, should be "fresh ingredients", "proper tools")

### Including connecting verbs between phrases

Students include verbs that connect separate key phrases but should be excluded

**Example:** Sentence: International trade agreements affect global economies. Keywords: "trade agreements affect" (Incorrect, "affect" should be excluded as it connects two key phrases)

### Omitting important descriptive adjectives

Students leave out adjectives that significantly change or define the noun

**Example:** Sentence: New technological advances improve productivity. Keywords: "technological advances" (Incorrect, missing important descriptor "new")



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Context: Critics say that innovative technology revolutionized modern manufacturing, Selected: Technology revolutionized manufacturing"

Correctly identifies complete phrases including both subject and action components

### Example: "Context: The new fashion show included beautiful modern clothes, Selected: new fashion show included beautiful modern clothes"

Selects complete meaningful phrases

### Example: "Context: The red dog barked loudly during the storm, Selected: red, dog, barked loudly, OR Selected: dog, barked, loudly, during, storm"

Selects complete meaningful phrases

### Example: "Context: The bright blue bird flew quickly into the nest, Selected: bird, flew, nest, OR Selected: bird, flew, into, nest, OR Selected: bird, nest"

Selects complete meaningful phrases while omitting non-essential connecting words, even though an action phrase is broken up or omitted

### Example: "Context: The writer needs creativity and technical skill, Selected: writer, creativity, technical skill"

Correctly separates two distinct key concepts rather than merging them with "and"

### Example: "Context: The unstoppable avalanche thundered down the snowy mountain slope, Selected: unstoppable avalanche, snowy mountain slope"

Correctly selects the key noun phrases while omitting the action verb "thundered" and the connecting phrase "down the"



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Sentence: The powerful storms devastated coastal regions, Selected: the, storms devastated coastal regions"

Includes the non-essential word "the"

### Example: "Sentence: The artist used brushes and vibrant paints, Selected: artist, used, brushes and vibrant paints"

Incorrectly merges two separate key phrases "brushes" and "vibrant paints" by including the connecting word "and"

### Example: "Sentence: Successful negotiations require patience and active listening, Selected: negotiations, patience and active listening"

Should separate "patience" and "active listening" as distinct key concepts rather than keeping them merged with "and"

### Example: "Sentence: International trade agreements affect global economies, Selected: International trade agreements affect, global economies"

Incorrectly includes the connecting verb "affect" with the first key phrase, when it should be excluded

### Example: "Sentence: New software update introduced advanced features, Selected: software update, advanced features"

Missing the important descriptive adjective "new" that significantly changes the meaning of "software update"

### Example: "Sentence: Skilled pilots navigate harsh weather with careful judgment, Selected: pilots, harsh weather, careful judgment"

Missing the defining adjective "skilled" that is essential to the meaning of the first key phrase

### Example: "Sentence: My brother collected various rare coins throughout his travels, Selected: rare coins"

Missing the important descriptor "various" from the key phrase "various rare coins" and completely omitting the second key phrase "travels"

# 121-convert-sentence-to-notes

## Goal

Help students develop effective note-taking skills by converting complete sentences into concise notes using keywords and symbols where appropriate.

### Secondary Goals

- Identify key information in sentences
- Learn to use standard note-taking symbols
- Practice condensing information while maintaining meaning
- Develop skills in organizing information hierarchically
- Master the balance between brevity and completeness

## How It Works

This activity helps students develop note-taking skills:
1. Students are presented with a complete sentence
2. They must identify the key information and relationships
3. Convert the sentence into notes using appropriate symbols and abbreviations

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on basic note structures. Notes should capture main ideas.

### Level 2

Incorporate more complex thoughts and ideas. Notes should show relationships and hierarchies between ideas.

## Important Principles for Grading

Generally preserve key information, meaning, and relationships
OK if a few minor details, or one major detail, is omitted.
Notes can be written as a complete sentence as long as the meaning is clear and more concise
Be very lenient about notes that dont fundamentally change the meaning of the sentence
Omit words such as the, and, and a
Err on the side of leniency

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Missing key information

Students might omit essential details while trying to be concise

**Example:** Sentence: High temperature and pressure form diamonds deep in the Earth. Notes: diamonds made in earth (missing key concepts: temperature, pressure)

### Incorrect symbol usage

Using symbols incorrectly or inconsistently

**Example:** Sentence: Hot air balloons float in the sky. Notes: balloons -> hot air (symbol doesnt make sense in this context)

### Unclear relationships

Failing to show how ideas connect

**Example:** Sentence: The boy is the owner of the dog. Notes: boy + dog (doesnt show relationship between boy and dog)



## Format Requirements

### Maintain logical structure while being concise

**Correct Example:** Sentence: Veterinarians treat animals like cats, dogs, and turtles. Notes: veterinarians treat animals (cats, dogs)

**Incorrect Example:** Notes: (cats, dogs) treat veterinarians



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Sentence: When water freezes, it expands and becomes less dense. Notes: water freeze -> expands + becomes less dense"

Uses appropriate symbols, maintains relationships, captures all key information concisely.

### Example: "Sentence: Economic growth leads to increased job opportunities and higher wages via expansion. Notes: fiscal growth good for employment"

Generally follows the structure of the original sentence and includes most key ideas.

### Example: "Sentence: Anacondas, which are green, live in forests, often surrounded by both predator and prey. Notes: anacondas live in trees often surrounded by predators + prey"

Generally follows the structure of the original sentence and includes most key ideas



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Sentence: Deforestation causes soil erosion and reduces biodiversity. Notes: trees gone, soil problems, bad for world"

Fails to show cause-effect relationships, introduce a concept (bad for world) not present in the original sentence.



---

# 122-convert-notes-to-sentence

## Goal

Help students practice converting abbreviated notes into complete, grammatically correct sentences

### Secondary Goals

- Develop ability to expand shorthand notes into full ideas
- Practice creating coherent sentences from fragmented information
- Build skills for effective communication and writing
- Improve understanding of sentence structure and grammar
- Learn to interpret note symbols and abbreviations in context

## How It Works

This activity follows a two-step process:
1. Students are presented with a set of notes that may include symbols, abbreviations, and key phrases
2. Students convert these notes into a complete, grammatically correct sentence that captures the meaning of the notes

## Grade-Appropriate Considerations

### Level 1

Focus on simple sentence construction with basic subject-verb structure. Notes will be straightforward with minimal symbols.

### Level 2

Expect more complex sentence structures including compound and complex sentences. Notes may include more symbols and abbreviations.

## Important Principles for Grading

The primary goal is to assess if the student has captured the MEANING of the notes in their sentence
Be VERY LENIENT with exact wording - students should be able to use their own words
The sentence should include key concepts from the notes
The sentence should be grammatically correct and make logical sense
Students may add connecting words, articles, and other grammatical elements not present in the notes
Students may rearrange the order of concepts as long as the meaning remains intact
Students may use synonyms or alternative phrasings for concepts in the notes
Students may elaborate slightly on concepts as long as they don't change the core meaning
Students may interpret symbols (like +, →, =) in various appropriate ways
Check that all key concepts from the notes are included in some form
Verify that the relationships between concepts (cause/effect, comparison, etc.) are preserved
Confirm the sentence makes logical sense and communicates a coherent idea
Do NOT expect verbatim reproduction of the notes - paraphrasing is encouraged and synonyms are allowed
Do NOT penalize creative interpretations of symbols as long as they make sense
Do NOT require specific sentence structures - various approaches can be correct
Do NOT expect students to include every minor detail if the main concepts are covered

## Common Mistakes to Anticipate

### Missing key concepts

Students may omit important information from the notes in their sentence

**Example:** Notes: climate change → rising sea levels + coastal flooding
Sentence: "Climate change causes rising sea levels." (Missing the concept of coastal flooding)

### Misinterpreting symbols

Students may misunderstand what symbols like →, +, or = represent in the context

**Example:** Notes: exercise + healthy diet = weight loss
Sentence: "Exercise with a healthy diet loses weight." (Misinterpreted "=" as a process rather than a result)

### Changing the meaning

Students may add information that alters the original meaning of the notes

**Example:** Notes: pollution ↑ → health problems ↑
Sentence: "When pollution decreases, health problems increase." (Reversed the relationship)



## Positive Examples

### Example: "Notes: climate change → rising temperatures + extreme weather events
Sentence: "Climate change leads to rising temperatures and extreme weather events.""

Correctly converts the notes into a complete sentence that captures all key concepts and the causal relationship indicated by the arrow

### Example: "Notes: regular exercise + balanced diet = improved health
Sentence: "Regular exercise combined with a balanced diet results in improved health.""

Successfully interprets the "=" symbol as indicating a result and includes all key concepts

### Example: "Notes: water cycle: evaporation → clouds → precipitation → collection
Sentence: "The water cycle consists of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation""

Correctly interprets the main ideas and the relationship between the concepts, even if the words are slightly different

### Example: "Notes: technology advances → productivity ↑ + jobs (changing not ↓)
Sentence: "Advances in technology lead to increased productivity while changing jobs rather than reducing them.""

Captures the complex relationship between multiple concepts and correctly interprets the parenthetical clarification

### Example: "Notes: reading daily = vocabulary ↑ + comprehension skills ↑
Sentence: "Reading every day improves both vocabulary and comprehension skills.""

Uses synonyms ("every day" for "daily", "improves" for "=") while maintaining the meaning



## Negative Examples

### Example: "Notes: deforestation → habitat loss + species extinction
Sentence: "Deforestation causes habitat loss.""

Missing a key concept (species extinction) from the notes

### Example: "Notes: social media use ↑ → face-to-face interaction ↓
Sentence: "Social media use and face-to-face interaction are related.""

Fails to capture the specific relationship (inverse correlation) between the concepts

### Example: "Notes: renewable energy / initial cost ↑ / long-term savings ↑
Sentence: "Renewable energy initial cost long-term savings.""

Not a complete sentence; missing verbs and proper structure

### Example: "Notes: stress + poor sleep = reduced immune function
Sentence: "Reduced immune function happens because of stress and poor sleep.""

Reverses the cause-effect relationship presented in the notes

### Example: "Notes: urban gardens → community building + local food source
Sentence: "Urban gardens destroy communities and eliminate local food sources.""

Completely changes the meaning to the opposite of what the notes indicate
