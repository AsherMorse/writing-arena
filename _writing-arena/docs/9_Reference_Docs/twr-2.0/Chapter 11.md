# CHAPTER 11

**A Gauge and a Guide: Assessing Students' Writing**

Mya was a third grader at a school with a high-poverty population. Over 75% of students came from socioeconomically disadvantaged families, and Mya was one of them.

At the beginning of the year, Mya's teacher, Mr. Corwin, gave his students a prompt to gauge their writing skills. Exhibit 11.1 shows what Mya

wrote.

**Exhibit 11.1**

The paragraph had no particular structure. In fact, it was just one long run-on sentence. It sounded just like Mya did when she spoke in class.

Mya's school was partnering with The Writing Revolution organization, and Mr. Corwin got training in the Hochman Method from the organization's faculty. Over the course of the year, he was able to teach his students how to construct sentences and outline paragraphs.

At the end of the year, Mr. Corwin gave Mya and her classmates another prompt, to see how their writing skills had progressed. Mya's SPO

and paragraph are shown in Exhibits 11.2 and 11.3.

**Exhibit 11.2**

**Exhibit 11.3**

Mr. Corwin realized that Mya still had a few things to learn about writing. But when he looked back at her beginning-of-the-year writing sample, he was struck by the differences he saw. Her paragraph now had a clear structure, with a topic and concluding sentence and supporting details. Her sentences were complete and didn't run on indefinitely. She was able to use transitions to connect her thoughts. And she had learned how to use subordinating conjunctions.

Mya's response to a writing prompt at the beginning of the year had provided her teacher with guidance on what skills she already had and what she needed to learn. And her end-of-year response revealed—to her and to Mr. Corwin—how far she had come in just one school year.

**Don't Guess—Assess! **

**WHY ASSESS YOUR STUDENTS' WRITING? **

Enables you to pinpoint skills individual students have or need to acquire

Provides information about the skills you need to focus on for your class as a whole

Helps you set goals for individual students and your class

Tracks the progress your students make over the course of the year

**Using Writing to Monitor Learning**

The strategies and activities you have read about in this book teach students writing skills and guide them to acquire knowledge on a daily basis. As you have probably noticed, they also have great value in revealing how much students are learning, not only about writing skills, but also about the material they are studying. In other words, these activities serve as **formative assessments**. They will help you to monitor your students'

comprehension of material that has been taught, determine your next instructional steps, and enable you to provide explicit, effective feedback that will move students forward.

In many schools, particularly at the elementary level, students' progress in literacy is measured by periodic “benchmark” assessments designed to evaluate general comprehension skills like “finding the main idea” of a text. Studies have found that such tests are highly unreliable. In one study, about a thousand children took four different standardized measures of comprehension. Researchers found that the odds of any two tests identifying the same student as a poor reader or a high-achieving one were less than half.1

And because the reading passages on the tests are unrelated to topics in the curriculum, the tests also don't even attempt to assess what students have learned about any content they may have been taught. Writing activities like those described in this book can be a far more reliable and accurate measure of learning—for students, their parents, and their teachers.

Formative assessments have other advantages as well. When students get prompt and regular feedback, they have a clearer sense of what they've accomplished and what they still need to work on.

In addition, research has shown that when formative assessment is done frequently, it's one of the most effective ways to enable students to transfer information to long-term memory—a key step in learning. 2

Here is an example of formative assessment if your class has read _Night_.3

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems.

The prisoners are forced on a death march because **_they have to evacuate the concentration camp. _**

The prisoners are forced on a death march, but **_Eliezer manages to survive. _**

The prisoners are forced on a death march, so **_most die from fatigue, disease, and the bitter cold weather. _**

**Summative assessments**, which occur at the end of a unit of study, measure what learning students have gained over a period of time—at least in theory. When standardized state reading tests are used as summative assessments, they rarely serve that purpose. They usually do not measure the writing skills you have taught, and, as with standardized benchmark assessments, the content of the passages is unlikely to align to the content of the curriculum you're using. In any event, the results are generally not available until months after the tests have been administered. It makes far more sense to use summative assessments, including those that require written responses, grounded in content that has actually been taught.

**Periodic Assessments to Monitor Writing Progress**

In addition to using TWR activities to monitor your students' progress in learning content you have taught, you should also give periodic assessments specifically aimed at measuring their progress in acquiring writing skills.

For these kinds of assessments, provide prompts on generic topics that give you a sense of where your students are in relation to each other, what their general strengths and weaknesses are, and what your goals for writing instruction should be.

At the beginning, middle, and end of the school year, it's important to assess:

What skills have been transferred to independent writing

What skills your students need to acquire

You should give your students a simple prompt without providing guidance or assistance. Be sure the topic is one that your students know well enough to write about coherently. All your students should have the same prompt so that it will be easier for you to analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

A prompt can consist of a single word or a brief phrase. Some prompts we have found to be useful are:

Friends (or friendship or how to make/keep friends)

Hopes for the future

Role model

Special gift or possession

Personal goals

Favorite season

Favorite pastime

Why do we study the past? \*

- For older students.

One of the skills you are evaluating is a student's ability to write a topic sentence, so avoid prompts that provide a “sentence starter.” If the prompt is

“a great school trip,” for example, many students will start the assignment with those four words. Simple phrases such as “school trip” or “role model” make better prompts.

Alternatively, you can provide more explanation. For example, rather than simply asking students to write about “a role model,” you could give them the following paragraph:

_A role model is someone you admire for having qualities you would like to have. A role model is a person whose behavior or achievements you_ _respect. Think about someone you consider a role model, and write about why that person is special to you. You may choose someone you know_ _or someone you have read about. You may choose someone who is alive today or someone who is no longer here but has made a lasting_ _impression on you_.

Another word of caution: try to avoid prompts that are apt to yield lists, such as “winning the lottery” or “my favorite things.”

Many other subjects could work well as prompts, and you, as the teacher, are the best judge of what your particular students are likely to be able to write about.

You may not want to use the same prompt for all three writing assessments at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. However, it can provide a clearer basis for comparison if you stay with the same general topic. For example:

**Beginning of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or more interesting parts of [previous grade level]. Describe at least two.

**Middle of the year:**

Write a paragraph about which subject is your favorite and why. Give two or three reasons.

**End of the year:**

Write a paragraph about the best or most interesting parts of [ending grade level]. Describe at least two.

**How to Administer Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

When you are administering the assessment, the first step is to **explain the purpose of the activity**. Let your students know that the assessment will help you understand where they need help to further develop their writing skills. Remind them to do their best work so you'll be able to see what they already know how to do and what they still need help with.

To get an accurate picture of what students can do independently, try not to give them any help during the assessment. If a student has difficulty spelling a word, for example, ask him to make his best guess and provide the correct spelling only if he's unable to continue. If a student just can't get started, you might have to provide her with a general suggestion or a topic sentence. **If you do need to provide students with help, be sure to** **note on the assessment exactly what was done with teacher support. **

Your **instructions must be explicit**. First, make it clear that students should keep their writing samples brief. If you're teaching first graders, you may want to tell them that it's fine to write just a sentence or two. Even with older Level 1 and some Level 2 students, it's best to limit the samples to a single paragraph. You'll be asking them to revise and edit their work later, and that may feel overwhelming if they've written at length.

**If students have learned how to develop an SPO, be sure to remind them to complete one before writing so that you can assess** **their outlining skills. ** If Level 2 students have been taught to develop Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (TOs and MPOs), you might allow them to write up to three paragraphs—after completing an outline, of course. Be sure that students' outlines are attached to their writing samples.

Typically, these assessments will take no more than one class period to complete, but some students may take less time. **Return the assessment** **samples to students in the next day or two and ask them to revise and edit their work. ** Tell them that the best writers often find ways to improve and correct their work and that it's important for you to see what they would like to change in their writing.

**It's not necessary to have students make final copies of the assessment, unless the revised and edited version is illegible. **

When the allotted time for revision and editing is up, collect the students' samples and date them. After assessing a student's work, put it in a dedicated folder so you can monitor individual progress.

**How to Evaluate Beginning‐, Middle‐, and End‐of‐Year Writing Assessments**

As we noted in Chapter 6, the following four criteria are generally used to assess writing quality.

**STRUCTURE**

Are the sentences in the paragraph, or the paragraphs in a longer composition, arranged appropriately?

**COHERENCE**

Are the sentences (and paragraphs) logically related to one another?

**UNITY**

Does every sentence support the main idea of the paragraph?

Does every paragraph support the main idea of the composition?

**WELL‐CONSTRUCTED SENTENCES**

Are the sentences grammatically correct and clear?

Are there compound and complex sentences in addition to simple, active ones?

Do the sentences begin in a variety of ways?

Judging the quality of student writing may be one of the most difficult tasks in all of educational assessment. Some aspects of writing are easy to quantify—total number of words or sentences, sentence length, spelling, or proper grammar and usage—but others are highly subjective.

Even experts have disagreed on the best way to go about measuring writing quality. “Over the years,” one team of experts has written, “writing assessment research and practice has suffered from dissension at every point, on almost every feature of stimulating, producing, evaluating, and teaching writing.” 4

Several factors can interfere with the accuracy of writing assessments:

**Decoding. ** When students are asked to write in response to a written prompt, some may have difficulty decoding it.

**Background information. ** Lack of knowledge about the topic causes some students to have trouble understanding the prompt and/or producing a response.

**Computers. ** If students write their responses on computers, those who are comfortable using computers will have an advantage over those who aren't.

**Mechanical errors. ** There are questions about how much weight to give to errors in capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and grammar.

Although students need to master these aspects of writing, technical mistakes can be distracting and lead teachers to overlook the progress students may have made in organizing their ideas or using complex sentence structures.

**Handwriting. ** Poor handwriting often has a negative influence on the evaluator. We'll address the subject of handwriting in more detail later in this chapter.

**RESOURCE**

Writing Assessment Checklists _Appendix F_

The **Writing Assessment Checklists** (Appendix F) can't entirely eliminate the difficulties involved in evaluating writing, but they can provide

guidelines for more accurate judgments, grounded in strategies you have taught. They will tell you where each student stands and can be filled out fairly quickly.

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Although there's been disagreement among experts about the best way to evaluate students' writing, one meta-analysis of 136 studies of

writing assessment came up with some recommendations.5 They make the most sense when applied to students above third grade, when

most have already acquired the basic mechanics of writing.

Use assessments to provide students with feedback about the effectiveness of their writing.

Teach students how to evaluate the effectiveness of their own writing.

Monitor students' progress in writing on an ongoing basis.

The report also listed six best practices in writing assessment:

**Allow students to use either paper or computers to write—or have them use the medium you know they're used to. **

Studies have shown that students who use computers score better than those who write by hand—unless they have little experience using a computer to write, in which case they score worse.

**Try not to judge a writing sample on the basis of the student's handwriting. **

**Mask the students' identities when scoring papers**. Teachers may subconsciously give a student a higher or lower score depending on the quality of her previous work or her race, gender, or ethnicity. One easy way to guard against implicit bias is to have students put their names on the back of a paper rather than the front.

**Put students' papers in random order before scoring them**. Some studies have suggested that raters' scores will vary depending on the quality of the essays they've just read. If a rater has just read a series of high-quality essays, she's more likely to give the next piece of writing she reads a lower score—and vice versa.

**Collect multiple samples of each student's work. ** The quality of a student's writing often varies with the type of composition.

Some are better at writing narratives, and others may excel at argumentative or informational essays.

**Try to ensure the reliability of your scoring. ** Much of what goes into scoring a piece of writing is subjective. To control for that, schools can offer training for teachers on how to assess writing. Administrators can provide benchmark descriptions or examples for each point on a scale, have multiple teachers score each paper, and base scores on more than one writing task.

**Comparative Judgment: Another Way of Assessing Writing Quality**

An interesting approach to evaluating writing offers hope that the task will become easier. This method, offered through a British organization called No More Marking, is both more efficient and more reliable than standard methods. The method, called _comparative judgment_, involves having readers compare two pieces of student writing and decide which one is better. Studies have shown that when many such gut-level comparisons are

aggregated, the judgments are highly consistent.6

At TWR partner schools, teachers may use comparative judgment to assess writing progress. Usually the judging is done within a single grade level by teachers of that grade. Student names are not visible, and judging can be done anonymously.

After judging the writing samples, teachers discuss trends they are noticing across the grade, which informs their next steps for instruction. For example, if teachers notice that many students are not beginning their paragraphs with topic sentences, they can practice using the SPO and the scaffolding activities as a whole class to reinforce this skill.

Since assessment using comparative judgment takes far less time than other methods of evaluating student writing, teachers have the opportunity to see the writing of a broader range of students than is typical with other rating methods, enabling them to gain perspective that is both deeper and wider on strengths and areas that need improvement.

No More Marking provides lots of valuable data about how students are doing. Once teachers have that data, the Hochman Method provides the specific strategies that teachers can use to address the weaknesses in student writing that it identifies.

**Having Students Write in Response to What They've Read**

Many teachers have their students write in response to a specific passage rather than the general prompts we have recommended. There are some benefits, but also potential pitfalls to this approach.

**The Pros and the Cons**

Having students write about a passage they're given simulates more closely the kind of writing students will be asked to do on state assessments toward the end of the school year. Generally, state literacy tests give students a passage to read and ask them to write in response to it, citing evidence from the text. The tests may also ask students to read two different texts and compare them.

It's important to understand that using texts as a basis for writing assessments brings its own potential problems. Students may have trouble decoding the texts, or they may lack the background knowledge that would enable them to understand them—especially if the texts don't relate to content covered in the curriculum. If that's the case, the assessment will not be accurately measuring your students' writing skills.

**Handwriting Matters**

One significant problem as students draft and revise their paragraphs and compositions or take tests is the poor quality of their handwriting.

Although research hasn't established that using cursive confers cognitive benefits, it's clear there are other reasons to teach students how to use it.

Good handwriting—including well-formed cursive—can influence a reader's evaluation of the quality of a piece of writing. In addition, students who have never learned or don't use cursive are often unable to read documents, letters, and notes written in cursive. This can prove to be a disadvantage in reading certain text and in communicating with others. 7

Studies do indicate that it's important for children to have handwriting instruction of some kind as opposed to only learning to touch type on a computer. When students engage in the physical activity of carefully shaping letters, it increases their ability to recognize letters, promotes their

recall of words, and improves their spelling accuracy.8

Many schools no longer focus on handwriting instruction, whether cursive or printing. That has led to random acts of capitalization as well as to the failure on the part of many students to leave enough space between words.

**Maintaining Student Portfolios**

It's a good idea to keep a folder or portfolio of samples of each student's work and assessments throughout the year. This collection of a student's writing can provide a dramatic reminder of the progress a student has made—progress that otherwise might be overlooked. It also provides valuable information for the teacher who has the student the following year.

**To Sum Up**

When assessing student writing, be aware of the factors that can interfere with an accurate picture—such as a student's difficulty decoding or understanding the text used as a prompt and the frequency of mechanical errors.

Administer writing assessments in response to a prompt or a text three times a year to measure students' independent writing ability.

Assess students' ability to develop outlines.

Assess students' ability to revise and edit their work by allowing them to do so a day or two after the assessment is administered.

Use the Writing Assessment Checklists to recword individual students' progress and that of the class as a whole.

Use data from assessments to help set your objectives for the class as a whole and differentiate instruction to meet students' individual needs.

Maintain a folder or portfolio of each student's work to track progress made over the year.
