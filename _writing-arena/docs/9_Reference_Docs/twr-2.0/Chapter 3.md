## CHAPTER 3

**Sentence Expansion and Note-Taking: Elaborating on Information**

As part of a tenth-grade science unit on climate change, Mr. Yates had assigned his class an article about using biofuels instead of fossil fuels. 

He had found the article on a website that offered science texts at a high school level, and, after reading it himself, he thought his students would find it engaging. 

The article explained that biofuels, which are made from plants, are thought to be more climate-friendly than fossil fuels. But, in fact, as the article detailed, many biofuels end up being just as bad for the climate, if not worse, because a lot of fossil fuel is required to produce them. 

The next day, Mr. Yates gave his students a do-now question at the beginning of class to assess their understanding of the article: “Why are the most commonly used biofuels not climate-friendly?” 

The answers were disappointing. “They make the earth warmer,” a student named Michelle wrote, with no further explanation. A few students wrote responses that were impressively complete, but Mr. Yates noted they were all strikingly similar. He then realized why: students had simply copied their sentences from the article. 

How can a teacher like Mr. Yates help his students truly understand what they read—and demonstrate their understanding in writing? It's often not enough to merely ask them a question about a text they've read. They may need to be taught how to engage in activities that require them to think analytically about the content of the text and enable them to craft responses that reflect their thinking. Two such strategies are sentence expansion and note-taking, both of which we'll describe in this chapter. 

**Expanding Students' Knowledge and Responses**

**WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES? **

Enables students to anticipate what a reader needs to know and then to provide that information

Checks comprehension

Teaches note-taking strategies (key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols)

Develops the ability to summarize

Reinforces academic knowledge

Sentence expansion is one of the best techniques available to help students process new information in a manageable way, enabling them both to understand it and to transfer it to long-term memory. It can also help them gauge what information they need to include to make their writing intelligible to a reader who lacks extensive prior knowledge of the subject. 

**HERE'S HOW SENTENCE EXPANSION WORKS:**

1. Give your students a brief—but complete—sentence called a kernel sentence. At the same time, select appropriate question words for them to respond to from this list: *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how*. 

2. Then have your students provide answers to those question words in the form of notes. (In the second part of this chapter, we'll cover how to help students acquire the skill of note-taking.)

3. Finally, have students convert those notes into a complete sentence. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

It sprouts. 

What? ***seed***

When? ***after it gets water + sunlight***

Where? ***soil***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After it gets water and sunlight, a seed sprouts in the soil. ***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

Mesopotamians built ziggurats. 

When? ***ancient times***

Where? ***center of city-states***

Why? ***provide earthly homes for gods & goddesses***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***In ancient times, Mesopotamians built ziggurats at the center of city-states to provide earthly***

***homes for gods and goddesses. ***

**Creating a Kernel Sentence**

To familiarize your students with the concept of sentence expansion, use a simple, declarative sentence as your example of a kernel sentence. It should have only one verb and no modifiers. You might use something like “Jane ran.” or “The candidates will debate.” As with the other strategies, when you introduce it, it's not necessary to embed the example in the content you're teaching. It is important, though, to use a kernel that's grounded in a topic your students have knowledge about. 

When creating kernel sentences, make sure that you're not using a sentence fragment or omitting an object. To get the most out of this exercise—

especially later when you embed it in content—**the kernel must be a complete sentence**. “She enjoys,” for example, is not a sentence and can't be used as a kernel—it doesn't express a complete thought. **Avoid using commands**, such as “Run fast,” because students may have trouble determining who or what the subject is. 

**Choosing Question Words**

It's helpful to post a chart of the question words at eye level in your classroom. The questions words should be listed in the order shown in Exhibit

3.1:



**Exhibit 3.1**

Sentence expansion may seem simple, but it requires writers to put themselves in the place of the reader and figure out what the reader needs to know. 

**KEEP IN MIND THE FOLLOWING TIPS WHEN DEVELOPING SENTENCE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES:**

**You don't need to use all the question words with each kernel. ** When introducing the sentence expansion strategy, it's a good idea to present just one, two, or three. 

**The question words *when, where, ***** and *why***** are the best to use when introducing kernel sentences to Level 1 students. **

**The teacher should ALWAYS be the one to supply the question words—not the students. ** However, when writing independently, students should be able to expand sentences by selecting the question words they believe will give the reader the most relevant information. 

**The question words you choose will depend on the kernel you're using and the information you want your students to add. **

For example, if you use the kernel “Jim ran,” you won't use the question word *who*, because the reader already knows the answer. However, if the kernel is “He ran,” it would make sense to use the question word *who*. 

**The question words *who***** and *what***** will always correspond to a pronoun in the kernel. ** If you write the kernel, “It sank,” the response to the question word *what* would be, “the *Titanic*.” Try to use only one pronoun in a kernel. 

**Students need to have enough information about the topic to expand the sentence. ** If they don't know anything about the *Titanic*, for example, they won't know what “It” refers to in the kernel “It sank.” They will also need the information required to answer the question words. 

**When expanding a sentence, students should begin it with the response to *when*****. ** This gives them practice with a construction that is common in writing but not in speech. 

**When expanding sentences, students should not add information beyond what is included in the kernel or in their** **responses to question words. They should also not delete information from the kernel. **

**The question word *how***** can indicate a response that is an adverb:**

Ailish walked into the house *slowly*. 

**Or it can describe how something is done (by):**

Sarah figured out the answer *by* using her calculator. 





**TECHNICAL TIP**

**Formatting counts! ** When your students provide written answers to the question words you give them, they will be writing in note form rather than complete sentences. That means you'll need to provide them with worksheets that have *dotted* lines after the question words. 

**In TWR, dotted lines are *always***** used for notes (key words and phrases, abbreviations, and symbols), and solid lines are**

***always***** used for complete sentences. ** Make sure your students understand the difference between what is expected on the dotted lines and the solid ones. We describe how to provide instruction in writing notes in the following section. 

Students' expanded sentences need to be grammatically correct, with appropriate capitalization and punctuation. 

**Examples of Sentence Expansion in Content**

Once your students have the idea of sentence expansion, it's time to give them a sentence expansion activity that's embedded in content you're currently teaching. You have to decide what you want your students to learn from the activity, anticipate their responses, and assess whether they have enough knowledge to produce the responses you're looking for. 

Always remind your students that they should begin to expand with *when* if it is one of the question words. 

**English**

If you're reading  *Animal Farm* 1 by George Orwell, you might consider the following activity:

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

He called a meeting. 

Who? ***Old Major***

When? ***3 days b/4 he died***

Where? ***Manor Farm***

Why? ***encourage animals to revolt***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***Three days before he died, Old Major called a meeting at Manor Farm to encourage the***

***animals to revolt. ***

**Math**

If you're teaching math and covering the distributive property, you might give your students the following problem: Then you could give students a hypothetical student's answer along with the kernel:

She made a mistake. 

Students would then have to answer the question words *who*, *when*, and *why*. The resulting expanded sentence might look like what is shown here: Jasmine's Work

Problem

Step 1

Step 2

Answer

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

She made a mistake. 

Who? ***Jasmine***

When? ***Step 1***

Why? ***didn't distribute 2 to both terms inside ()***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***In step 1, Jasmine made a mistake because she didn't distribute the 2 to both of the terms inside***

***the parentheses. ***

**History**

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

She became pharaoh. 

Who? ***Hatshepsut***

When? ***after husband died***

Why? ***b/c stepson too young to rule Egypt***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After her husband died, Hatshepsut became pharaoh because her stepson was too young to***

***rule Egypt*****. **

**Science**

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the sentence. 

They make good barriers. 

What? ***lipids***

Where? ***around cells***

Why? ***non-polar***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***Lipids make good barriers around cells because they are non-polar. ***

The following supporting activities can help deepen student understanding of why, when, and how to use this strategy. 

**Level 1 Sentence Expansion Scaffolds**

If you're reading  *Charlotte's Web* 2 by E.B. White, you might consider the following activity:

**DIRECTIONS:** Which word tells *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, or *how*? 

farms

***where*** quickly

***how*** 

rabbits

***what*** yesterday ***when*** 

carefully

***how*** 

inside

***where*** 

the fair

***where*** Charlotte ***who*** 

Mr. Arable ***who*** 

newspaper ***what*** 

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify what the underlined words tell: *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, or *how*? 

Leonardo da Vinci was born in Italy. 

***where*** 

At the age of 14, da Vinci became an artist's apprentice. 

***when*** 

The Medici family employed da Vinci for years. 

***who*** 

Between 1503 and 1519, da Vinci painted the *Mona Lisa*. 

***when*** 

Da Vinci moved to France because he was invited by King Francis I. ***why*** 

**DIRECTIONS:** Identify the question word(s)— *who*, *what, when*, *where*, *why*, and/or *how*—that were used to expand each kernel sentence. 

**KERNEL:** They tag butterflies. 

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** Scientists tag butterflies because they want to track their travel routes. 

**QUESTION WORDS:** ***who, why________________________________________***

**KERNEL:** Monarch butterflies migrate. 

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** At the end of October, monarch butterflies migrate to Southern California and Mexico. 

**QUESTION WORDS:** ***when, where_____________________________________***

**Level 2 Sentence Expansion Scaffolds**

If your class is reading  *Frankenstein* 3 by Mary Shelley, you might consider the following activity:



**DIRECTIONS:** Underline and then identify the question word(s)— *who, what, when, where, why*, and/or *how*—that were used to expand each kernel sentence. 

**KERNEL:** She published *Frankenstein*. 

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** In 1818, Mary Shelley published *Frankenstein*. 

**QUESTION WORDS:** ***when, who____________________________________***

**KERNEL:** He is feverish. 

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** Every night, Dr. Frankenstein is feverish because he is obsessed with finding the secret of life. 

**QUESTION WORDS:** ***when, who, why_______________________________***

**Differentiating Sentence Expansion Activities**

If your students need additional support:

Put a star next to the word *when* on the worksheet to remind students to start their expanded sentences with their answer to that word. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 

She won the Nobel Peace Prize. 

Who? ***Malala***

★ When? ***2014***

Why? ***because she fought for girls' education***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***In 2014, Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize because she fought for girls' education. ***

Number the question words in the order you want students to use the answers in their expanded sentences. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 

She won the Nobel Peace Prize. 

(2) Who? ***Malala***

(1) When? ***2014***

(3) Why? ***because she fought for girls' education***

**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***In 2014, Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize because she fought for girls' education. ***

**BE CAREFUL**

It's important to be especially careful when giving students sentence expansion activities—there are many ways to create unintended confusion. Remember these guidelines:

**Tell your students not to expand the kernel** by adding information that is not in their responses to the question words, or by substituting other words for those that are in the kernel (unless it's a pronoun) or deleting information from it. 

**The question word *when***** should refer only to a specific time or time period, not in the sense of *whenever*** (e.g., “When I eat too much, my stomach hurts.”). 

**If you will be using *who***** or *what***** as question words, include a corresponding pronoun in the kernel. ** If one of the question words is *who*, and the answer is “Lincoln,” the kernel should read, “He issued an order.” If one of the question words is *what*, and the answer is “the book,” the kernel should read, “It was stolen.” 

**Commands should not be used as kernels. ** “Ride cars” or “Go fast” can be confusing because the subject is implied. If you ask *who*, it's not clear what response you're expecting. 

**Fragments can't be kernels! ** “In the school yard” and “Irrigation of deserts” are not kernels. 

**Keep kernels brief (three or four words). **

Even though you want students to begin their response with *when*—if that's one of your question words—**always list the question** **words on the worksheet in the same order as they appear on the wall chart: *who, what, when, where, why, ***** and *how*****. **

This sequence of the terms is commonly used, and it's helpful for students to get used to it. 

**Remember that you, NOT the students, choose the question words**. If students choose their own question words, they may leave out important information. Once they become more experienced writers, they can come up with question words to expand sentences when they're revising their own writing. 

**The Power of Note-Taking: Key Words and Phrases, Abbreviations, and Symbols**

We often assume that students will just figure out how to take notes efficiently, but that's not always the case. Considering how frequently we're required to take notes throughout our lives, we believe that giving students a solid foundation in note-taking will benefit them in multiple ways. That

foundation should include teaching students how to identify important words and phrases and how to use symbols and abbreviations. Many students need explicit instruction in how to distill information into note form, using abbreviations and symbols. 

**WHY PRACTICE NOTE-TAKING? **

Helps students distinguish essential from nonessential material

Boosts comprehension

Enables the absorption and retention of information

Promotes analytical thinking

Enables students to outline paragraphs and compositions before drafting them

Converting text or speech to notes is one of the most valuable skills you can teach your students. It's far more than just a quick way to get information down on paper—although it does serve that purpose. It's a way of enabling students to process and understand what they've read, heard, and learned. 

Changing sentences to notes requires students to extract the most important words and phrases and render them in a different mode of expression. 

That exercise prevents rote copying, ensures comprehension, and promotes absorption and retention of information. For more information on these benefits of note-taking, see the Ask the Experts section. 

Learning to identify key words and phrases in a text and reduce them to notes is also a crucial step in the Hochman Method. Your students will need to know how to use key words and phrases to respond to the question words you provide for sentence expansion activities. They'll use the same technique to produce outlines for paragraphs and compositions—and to take notes on their reading or what they're learning in class. 

As students gain more experience, they will create their own unique note-taking style. However, initially it's crucial to introduce them to specific techniques and give them plenty of practice with them. 

**Note-taking is not only a valuable skill; it's also a powerful way to boost comprehension and reinforce knowledge. **

**Introducing Students to Note-Taking**

As with all TWR activities, when you're introducing students to note-taking, model the activity first. Although it's not essential to embed the sentences in the content of the curriculum at this point, it will provide an opportunity to boost students' learning when you do—assuming it's content that has already been covered. 

The following sequence for modeling note-taking activities can be done with the whole class. Each step can be followed by independent practice. (The example below would be appropriate for students in fourth grade and up. For grades 1–3, only key words and phrases should be used for notes—not symbols and abbreviations.)

1. **Underline key words and phrases in a sentence. ** (Be sure the sentence has several substantive words and phrases.) The magma chamber is a zone of molten rock. 

2. **Convert a sentence into notes. **

The magma chamber is a zone of molten rock. 

***magma chamber = zone/molten rock***

3. **Convert given notes into a sentence. **

↑ gases → magma blasting through Earth's surface

***The increase of gases leads to magma blasting through Earth's surface*****. **

Introduce your students to common abbreviations such as *b/c* for *because, w/* for *with, * and *w/o* for *without*. Remind them that when they're writing notes, they should omit words such as *the, and, * and *a*. 

The following chart lists some of the most frequently used symbols. Note that the = sign can also be used to indicate an appositive. 





**RESOURCE**

Abbreviations and Symbols *Appendix B*

Consider posting this chart where students can refer to it. See Appendix B for a more extensive chart of common abbreviations and symbols. 

**BE CAREFUL**

Don't try to teach students to underline and take notes from texts with simple, unelaborated sentences. In these materials, often many of the words and sentences are equally meaningful, making the task of identifying the most important ideas or words impossible. This is especially true of material that has been adapted for younger or struggling readers. 

When using abbreviations and symbols, make sure you don't use slashes to break up a thought cluster. For example, you would not want students to write notes on the Continental Congress like this:

**INCORRECT NOTE-TAKING:**

We're not providing Level 1 examples of note-taking activities because Level 1 students should mainly use key words and phrases under a teacher's

guidance, when engaging in sentence expansion activities and creating Single-Paragraph Outlines. The latter are described in detail in Chapter 6. 

**Level 2 Examples**

**DIRECTIONS:** Change the sentences into notes (key words, phrases, abbreviations, and symbols). 

1. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria, led to World War I. 

***assassination of Franz Ferdinand = archduke of Austria*** **→ *WWI***

2. At the beginning of World War I, the Allies were France, the United Kingdom, and Russia, while the Central Powers were Germany and Austria-Hungary. 

***beg. of WWI/Allies = France, UK, + Russia/Central Powers = Germany + Austria-Hungary***

**DIRECTIONS:** Change the notes into sentences. 

1. Neolithic Rev. = 1st Agricultural Rev. → civilization

***The Neolithic Revolution, the first Agricultural Revolution, led to civilization*****. **

2. invention of new tools → easier farming + ↑ food supply

***The invention of new tools led to easier farming and an increased food supply. ***

**ASK THE EXPERTS**

Research has shown that note-taking generally improves learning, for two reasons. 

Note-taking produces more engagement with content, leading to better retention and comprehension. 

There's a second boost when (or if) students review their notes to study the material. 

Teaching students how to use key words, phrases, abbreviations, and symbols helps by making it easier for students to distill and write down information. 

It's easier for students to take notes when reading or when listening to a recorded lecture. They can pause to think and write down information rather than having to do that while trying to keep up with what the teacher is saying. In fact, one way teachers can make note-taking during class easier is to pause, giving students time to take notes. They might also have students use a break to look over and revise their notes, perhaps with a partner or in a small group. Studies have shown that when students revise their notes, they retain more information—especially if that happens *during* a class rather than after it's over, or during a pause in reading.4

Another way to make note-taking easier is to alert students to how many points you'll be making or to simply say something like, “This is an

important point—be sure to add it to your notes.”5 Research has found that providing students with complete, well-written notes  *after* they've

taken their own notes can significantly boost their learning.6

Teachers can also provide “guided notes,” such as an outline that includes some information but leaves space for students to fill in notes on

key points. That approach can substantially increase student achievement across all grade levels, including for students with disabilities.7

Simply giving students complete, prewritten notes, however, is unlikely to work well. 

There's also been research on the relative advantages of taking notes by hand rather than on a laptop or other digital device. Students can take notes faster on a laptop, which enables them to pay more attention to what the teacher is saying. However, taking notes on a computer can result in a transcript of what is being said rather than a summary of important points. Taking notes by hand may lead to deeper processing of the material, since students need to analyze the information and extract what is most important. 8

Whether using a laptop or taking notes by hand is better may depend on the student and the material. If the material is complex and hard to follow, it might make more sense for students to type their notes, giving them more time and cognitive capacity to attend to what the teacher is saying. 9 They can then go over their notes and, if necessary, revise later. 

Bear in mind that note-taking can impose a heavy burden on **working memory**, especially if a student is trying to take notes during a live lecture. That's because the student has to understand what the teacher is saying, figure out the key points, possibly connect them to points that have already been made, summarize or paraphrase the information—and then write it down while the teacher is moving on to the next point. All of that can impose a significant cognitive load, possibly *diminishing* understanding and retention.10

In the months that followed Mr. Yates's disappointing experiences with the articles on biofuels, he guided his students through sentence expansion activities and taught them the skills of note-taking: how to identify the key words in a sentence, how to use arrows to indicate cause and effect, and how to abbreviate common words like *because*. He had posted a chart of symbols and abbreviations on the classroom wall, and students had become accustomed to using them. 

The class had moved on from climate change to animal behavior. One day, Mr. Yates assigned an article about why sharks sleep and told students to take notes on it during and after reading, using the skills they'd learned. He also gave them a kernel sentence to expand, with question words: “They sleep.” 

The next day in class, he gave them a do-now question: “What can data on shark sleep tell us about the function of sleep in animals generally?” 

Michelle—who had given a minimal answer to the question on biofuels months before—wrote this: “Scientists did an experiment showing that sharks use less energy when they sleep, which means they have a lower metabolic rate. The scientists say that supports their hypothesis that sleep helps animals, including humans, conserve energy.” 

As Mr. Yates read through Michelle's response and others, he found himself smiling. The students hadn't just parroted the article, and their answers showed they had truly understood its content. He felt he had helped set them up for success in eleventh grade—and beyond. 

**To Sum Up**

List question words on a wall chart in this order: *who*, *what*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how*. 

Provide kernel sentences that express complete thoughts but are **not** commands, questions, or fragments. 

Level 1 students should start expanding sentences using the question words *when, where, * and *why*. 

There should be only one pronoun in a kernel. 

Students should write answers to question words in note form on dotted lines and write their expanded sentences on solid lines. 

Students should begin their expanded sentences with *when* if it is one of the question words. 

Students' expanded sentences should not add, delete, or substitute information (unless it's replacing a pronoun). 

Use sentence expansion activities to help students anticipate what the reader needs to know. 

Use sentence expansion activities to check students' comprehension of content. 

Note-taking is a powerful strategy for gaining and retaining knowledge. 

Below mid–third grade, note-taking should be limited to key words and phrases. After that point, begin to add symbols and abbreviations at your discretion.
