# CHAPTER 13

**Putting the Method into Practice: Leave No Strategy Behind**

Throughout this book, we present TWR strategies in a linear fashion. But in practice, you should **not** aim to get all students to master a particular strategy and then move on, leaving that strategy behind. Since content and writing skills are so interconnected, “mastery” will depend as much on the content you're teaching as on any particular strategy. In addition, bringing back strategies you've already covered will help remind students to use them in their writing.

As a result, it's best to keep moving through your curricular sequence, continuously bringing previously taught strategies into your instruction and using them alongside others that you're introducing. As you move along, you can always modify strategies for students who are struggling.

**Laying a Strong Foundation: Sentence‐Level Activities**

As we pointed out in Chapter 2, sentences are the foundation for all writing. If students haven't learned to write a clear, coherent sentence, they'll

never be able to write a clear, coherent paragraph or essay. And sentence-level activities can be just as challenging for students as lengthier writing assignments—sometimes even more challenging. Whether students are writing a sentence, paragraph, or composition, the content drives the rigor.

All students, regardless of their grade or ability level, need to practice crafting various kinds of sentences. Throughout this book, you've seen multiple examples of TWR sentence activities for all levels and in all subjects.

If you're teaching beginning writers, English language learners, students with learning disabilities, or the many students who write the way they speak, the first step is to make sure they understand what a sentence is. As we noted in Chapter 1, simply getting them to repeat an abstract definition, such as “a sentence has a subject and predicate and expressses a complete thought,” is unlikely to be enough. They will need ample practice in distinguishing between complete sentences and fragments—and turning fragments into complete sentences. They'll also need practice in correcting run-on sentences.

Even if your students are more proficient writers, it is still important to introduce them to the whole range of TWR sentence strategies. The difference is that your pace can be faster. Level 2 students can do much of their sentence-level work in the context of expanding unelaborated paragraphs and improving their own writing in response to your specific feedback as they draft, revise, and edit. These students will also benefit from sentence activities used as comprehension checks on tests, quizzes, and exit slips.

Generally, all students, regardless of grade level, should practice at least some sentence activities daily, orally and in writing, whether through the kinds of checks we just listed or through do-now activities, stop-and-jots, turn-and-talks, or homework. When students are ready to develop outlines, continue to include regular practice with sentences in your lessons. As students start converting their outlines into drafts, they will need to use what they've learned from the sentence activities as tools for revision.

**Breaking Down the Writing Process**

To make writing manageable for your students, break down the process into four basic steps—outlining, drafting, revising and editing, and final copy

—as shown here.

1. **Outlining** \*

2. **Drafting**

3. **Revising/editing** \*

4. **Final copy**

Most instructional time should be spent on Steps 1 and 3 (hence the red stars), outlining and revising and editing the draft. Lessons can end after Steps 1 or 3—but not after Step 2.

Always have your students revise and edit a draft, whether or not they go on to turn it into a final copy.

The outlining and revising/editing stages need to be broken down into a number of smaller components—first in the context of paragraphs, and later in the context of compositions.

Don't skip any of the scaffolding steps; just speed up your rate for more proficient students. Make sure that all students have had practice identifying and constructing topic sentences before you ask them to create one for an SPO.

It's important to provide your students with plenty of demonstrations and practice to get them to the point where they'll be able to craft varied sentences; outline and write cohesive, coherent paragraphs and compositions; and revise their writing effectively. You may be tempted to let your students just plunge into a piece of writing without going through all these steps. After all, don't experienced writers do that? The answer is that some do and many don't. Especially for more analytical and longer forms of writing—books, for example—many accomplished writers find outlining to be essential, and **all** professional writers take time to revise.

Beyond that, experienced, competent writers are able to juggle numerous factors simultaneously so that composing becomes a recursive process.

They may fine-tune their sentences as they go, replacing a word here and omitting a comma there. They may repeatedly shift the order of paragraphs and ideas. But these writers can draw on ample writing experience as well as deep knowledge of both written language and their topic. They may be equipped to draft, revise, and even plan their writing more or less simultaneously.

The great majority of the students we work with, however, lack both that kind of experience and that level of knowledge. They need to approach the task one step at a time, while continuing to practice previously learned strategies, in order to produce an effective piece of writing. As with sentence activities, even after your students have become experienced at creating outlines and revising drafts, it's important to keep practicing the scaffolding activities that helped them arrive at that point.

**Pacing the Strategies: Using Your Judgment**

Teachers often ask questions like: “How long should we keep teaching fragments?” “When can we start the Single-Paragraph Outline?” “Should I stay with sentence expansion until I think the students have mastered it?” “How do we know when to start writing introductions?”

We understand that teachers want clear guidelines about the pacing of the strategies and at what point they should move on to the next one. We wish we could provide them with straightforward answers, but writing instruction doesn't work like that. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. You will need to determine where your students are at the outset, what they need, and how fast they are able to move through the sequence of strategies. The beginning-of-the-year writing assessment we discussed in Chapter 11 will help you determine your instructional priorities and objectives, and later formative assessments will guide you to modify them.

When deciding how long to spend on any one TWR strategy or activity, you have to exercise your own judgment about your students' oral and written language abilities. Among the factors to consider are the following:

Performance on beginning- and middle-of-year assessments

The grade level at which they were introduced to TWR strategies

Their familiarity with the conventions of English grammar

Their sense of what they need to include, omit, or revise in their writing so that it's understandable to a reader In addition—as we noted previously—writing, more than any other task, taxes a student's working memory and executive functions. Remember that there's a limit to how many things we can hold in our working memory. If your students are still struggling with the mechanics of writing—

handwriting, spelling, usage, and so on—they won't have the space in working memory to simultaneously think about higher-level aspects such as purpose, meaning, audience, word choice, and syntax. Before they can address those considerations in depth and without guidance, their lower-level skills will need to have reached a point where the mechanics are not absorbing most of their attention.

**Sequence of Activities through the Grades**

**The sequence on the following pages assumes that students are being introduced to the Hochman Method in the given grade** **level(s). ** If that's not the case for your students, you'll need to adjust accordingly. However, don't assume that simply because students are in ninth or tenth grade, they already understand the concept of a sentence or how to plan and construct an effective paragraph. We know from our experience that many high school students have yet to acquire these skills.

**All students who are being introduced to the method for the first time, no matter their grade level, should begin with sentence-level strategies and activities and proceed through the sequence in order. **

**It is not necessary for students to demonstrate mastery of every sentence strategy before moving on. Once they have been** **introduced to a few basic strategies, they can learn how to develop simple Single-Paragraph Outlines. ** They can also use those strategies to convert the words and phrases they've written on their outlines into sentences in a paragraph.

**The sequence is recursive. ** The activities for each of the following grades incorporate those introduced in all previous grades. They should be a regular part of instruction for middle and high school students, including both those who are familiar with the strategies and those who are new to the method. Always remember that when they're embedded in the content of the curriculum, these activities not only teach writing, but also are a powerful method of teaching subject matter.

Although this book is primarily a resource for grades 3–12, we thought it would be helpful to include what a K–2 sequence would look like as a foundation for the grades that follow.

**Pacing Guides**

Pacing guides displaying the preceding activities in the context of an academic year can be found on the Book Resources website.

TWR pacing guides are meant to be fluid. Sometimes you'll quicken the pace and at other times you'll need to backtrack. Bear in mind that your pace will be determined by your students' skill level, not their grade level. If you're teaching at the middle or high school level, you may be able to proceed through the sequence of strategies more rapidly than a teacher whose students are in the early elementary grades. But that may not be the case if your students are still learning English, have language-based learning disabilities, or face other challenges.
