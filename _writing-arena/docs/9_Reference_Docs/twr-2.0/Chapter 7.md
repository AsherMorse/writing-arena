## CHAPTER 7

### **Revision: Putting It All Together**

Over the course of the school year, Mr. Chambers's fifth-grade students had acquired an impressive array of sentence-level skills. They'd learned how to use basic and subordinating conjunctions and transition words, and they'd practiced adding appositives and using question words to expand kernel sentences. Mr. Chambers had also led them through the process of constructing a Single-Paragraph Outline (SPO), and they seemed to have grasped it. 

At the end of a unit on insects, Mr. Chambers asked his students to write a paragraph on the life cycle of the butterfly. He was looking forward to seeing how they would apply the strategies they'd learned to their independent writing. 

But when he started reading through what his students had produced, his heart sank. The paragraph written by a student named Mara was typical:

*The life cycle of a butterfly has four stages. The first one is the egg stage. The second one is the larva stage. The third one is the pupa* *stage. The last one is the adult stage. The life cycle of the butterfly is very interesting*. 

The essential information was there—barely. Mara had also written complete sentences, stayed on topic, and created topic and concluding sentences. But the paragraph was wooden and boring. 

Mr. Chambers was sure Mara knew how to construct more complex, varied, and informative sentences as well as how to use transitions to make her writing flow. She and her classmates had done a good job with all of those strategies when given sentence-level activities to work on, or when Mr. Chambers made specific suggestions to, for example, add an appositive to a sentence. But it seemed that, for some reason, they weren't able to apply those strategies to their own writing independently. 

What could he do, Mr. Chambers wondered, to enable them to internalize these strategies and become better independent writers? After all, he wasn't always going to be there to suggest that they add an appositive or use a subordinating conjunction. 

It's crucial to teach students specific writing strategies and then have them use activities you've modeled and created to practice those strategies. It's also crucial to give them targeted feedback on their writing. But that kind of practice and feedback is often not enough to enable them to produce fluent, graceful writing on their own. Of course, they need to learn how to edit their writing. But first, and more important, students need to learn how to revise it. 

**WHY PRACTICE REVISION ACTIVITIES? **

Leads to smoothly flowing, logically connected prose in paragraphs and compositions

Provides a way of incorporating substantive changes into a piece of writing

Enables students to use skills gained from sentence activities and outlining when writing at length

Students may find revision challenging unless it's presented as a step-by-step process. Providing them with an array of activities—which we'll demonstrate in the following sections—will help. 

**Revising versus Editing: An Important Distinction**

Many people see the concepts of revising and editing as one and the same since both processes are necessary to improve a piece of writing. For experienced writers, revising and editing may overlap, but when working with your students you should teach the two processes separately. 

Understanding the distinction between the two is a crucial first step in helping your students transform a boring and disjointed piece of writing into one that engages the reader and flows smoothly. 

**Revising: Improving the Substance**

**Revising** means clarifying or altering the content or structure of a draft. At its core, revising requires writers to put themselves in the shoes of a reader, anticipating what information that reader will need or want to know and determining how to communicate it as effectively as possible. 

Revising is what all good writers do, sometimes repeatedly, to make their writing clear, accurate, and fluid. It can be as simple as substituting a powerful adjective for one that falls flat or as complex as reorganizing the sequence of ideas in an essay to make an argument stronger. For beginning writers, it often involves turning simple rudimentary sentences into rich, complex ones or elaborating on vague ideas with details and examples. For many writers, it may mean eliminating unnecessary verbiage or streamlining convoluted sentence structure. 

To revise, students will build on the planning they engaged in when creating their SPOs. They will also draw on the skills they learned when practicing the sentence-level activities, including harnessing the power of transitions to make their writing flow. 

**Editing: Polishing the Prose**

**Editing**, although important, is often a less complex process. It involves identifying and then correcting errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization, syntax, and spelling. 

Most teachers focus on editing, probably because they are more comfortable with the mechanics and rules of writing. Similarly, if you ask students to improve on a piece of writing, they're likely to make mechanical changes because, when they know the rules, it's easier; adding a comma or capitalizing a proper noun isn't nearly as complex as imagining what a reader needs to know or reorganizing the content of their writing. But it's revising that deserves the lion's share of instructional time and students’ mental effort. To the extent that students do revise, they rarely engage in it with the specificity it requires. 

Experienced writers usually revise and edit simultaneously. However, it's best if students focus on revising *before* they edit. Only after students grow familiar with the process of revising should they be expected to edit, proofread, and otherwise refine their work. Revising may change the wording and structure of a piece of writing, so there's no point in fine-tuning words and passages that may disappear in the next draft. Editing an assignment before it has been revised is like icing a cake before it's fully baked. 

However, that doesn't mean that you should wait until students have reached the editing stage to start correcting their mechanical errors. Even if your objective is to help your students revise their work, you can still point out spelling and punctuation errors without shaping an entire lesson around them. At the end of this chapter, we'll go into further detail on how and when editing should be done. 

**Revision Activities**

The following activities support students’ ability to revise their work. 

**Enriching Simple Sentences through Sentence Expansion**

When your students convert the notes on their outlines into sentences on their drafts, they may produce only brief, simple statements, as Mara did, especially if they're beginning writers. Although short declarative sentences can provide emphasis and make facts clear, a steady succession of them makes for wooden prose. 

How can you guide students to expand these sentences into ones that are longer and richer? 

Remind them that when they've engaged in sentence expansion exercises, they've used question words such as *who*, *what***, ** *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how* to transform kernels into complex, information-packed sentences (see Chapter 3). Now they can use the same kinds of questions to expand the

brief sentences in their drafts in order to provide more information to the

reader—and, if they need some help, you can provide the appropriate question words as prompts. 

For example, let's say one of your students starts to use their outline to draft a paragraph about the book  *Frindle* 1 by Andrew Clements. They might

produce this simple sentence:

Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle.” 

At that point, you can ask: “Do you remember *why* he called it a ‘frindle’?” 

The student might respond: “Because he wanted to perform a language experiment and annoy his language arts teacher.” 

“Great!” you can say. “How about expanding the sentence to include that information?” 

That prompt enables the student to turn their simple sentence into this:

Nick Allen called a pen a “frindle” because he wanted to perform a language experiment and annoy his language arts teacher. 

**Introducing Sentence Variety**

Another way your students can liven up a boring draft is to vary their sentences in length and type. Remind students of the four different sentence types they can use (statement, question, exclamation, and command) and the possibility of beginning a sentence with a subordinating conjunction (see Chapter 4). 

Perhaps, for example, one of your students writes a sentence about colonial America that's followed by another sentence or two using a similar structure:

Colonists needed a way to travel and to water their crops. They settled near rivers. 

You might say, “How about combining those two sentences? And how about beginning with a subordinating conjunction?” The student might then write the following:

Since the colonists needed a way to travel and a way to water their crops, they settled near rivers. 

If you've been regularly assigning your students activities that give them practice with the various sentence-level strategies—embedded in the content they're studying—these techniques will be fresh in their minds. 

**Revisiting Topic and Concluding Sentences**

If your students have completed an SPO, they've already engaged in the process of creating interesting and informative topic and concluding sentences and writing them on an outline. As we detailed in Chapter 6, there are three basic strategies for creating a topic sentence:

Choose one of the sentence types. 

Begin the sentence with a subordinating conjunction. 

Add an appositive. 



You may consider activities in which you would ask students to improve a boring topic sentence as shown in the examples below. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive. 

**In this paragraph, I am going to tell you all about summer. **

1. ***Enjoy summer! ***

2. ***Although summer is a fantastic season, heat waves can be dangerous*****. **

3. ***Summer, a fantastic season, is popular with students because there is***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Improve the following topic sentence using the three strategies: a sentence type, a subordinating conjunction, and an appositive. 

**This paragraph is going to be about Genghis Khan. **

1. ***Genghis Khan was one of the most powerful leaders in history*****. **

2. ***Although there have been many memorable leaders, Genghis Khan was one of the most powerful*****. **

3. ***Genghis Khan, a powerful Mongol leader, created a large empire*****. **

**Choosing Vivid, Varied, and Precise Words**

One way of enlivening a sentence is to use strong and varied nouns and verbs, as well as modifiers and descriptive phrases. At first, you may need to show Level 1 students where to place adjectives and descriptive phrases in sentences, but eventually students will be able to find the correct placement on their own. 

If students favor overused, easy-to-spell adjectives such as *fun*, *nice*, or *good*, encourage them to find descriptive words that are more specific. You can brainstorm with students, provide them with a list of suggested alternative words, or explain how to use a thesaurus. Instead of *fun, * for example, a student might substitute *exciting* or *sensational*. Instead of *good*, you might suggest *enjoyable* or *fantastic*. It's often a pleasant surprise to see the better choices students make when they brainstorm for more precise and varied alternatives. 

If students have been reading *Because of Winn-Dixie*,2 you might give them the following activity:

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of adjectives for the bolded word below. 

Opal is a **nice** girl. 

***friendly respectful***

***generous compassionate***

***helpful***

***kind***



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Brainstorm a list of more precise words or phrases for each of the following bolded words or phrases. 

1. **A long time ago**, people fought for freedom. 

***During the Revolutionary War In the late 18th century***

***From 1775 to 1783***

***During the colonial period***

***After the Boston Tea Party***

***During the American War of Independence***

2. A long time ago, **people** fought for freedom. 

***the Continental Army***

***colonists***

***the New England colonies revolutionaries***

***the Sons of Liberty***

***Americans***

Two of the basic conjunctions, *but* and *so*, lead to more sophisticated words that students should be encouraged to use in their independent work. 

Remember that students should use the more sophisticated words in Exhibit 7.1 at the beginning of their sentences rather than in the middle. 

**but**

**so**

**change of direction cause → effect**

**↓**

**↓**

Although

Therefore

**Using Transitions to Create Flow**

Your students should be familiar with the transition words and phrases we discussed in Chapter 4. If you guide them to insert appropriate transition

words and phrases during the revision process, their writing will become significantly more fluid and coherent. To demonstrate how powerful these brief

insertions can be, show your students examples in literature or expository writing and have them identify where transitions are used. 

A transition may begin a sentence, creating a link between that sentence and the one that has preceded it, or link thoughts within a sentence. 

Transitions can also underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph's various sentences together. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

If your students have trouble deciding what kind of transition to use when revising, you can suggest a specific category from Appendix C for them to look at. With enough practice, they'll be able to find the right kind of transition independently. 

Transitions—when used correctly—are vital to the creation of coherent paragraphs and compositions. As a reminder, the basic types of transitions and their functions are shown in Exhibit 7.2. 

**Types of Transitions**

**Time and sequence**—provide sequence of events, steps in a process

**Conclusion**—express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution

**Illustration**—give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement

**Change of direction**—signal contrasting thoughts

**Emphasis**—prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated

**Exhibit 7.2** Transition Words and PhrasesTypes of Transitions

**TECHNICAL TIP**

The table of transitions in Appendix C describes the functions of the five types of transitions. It is not an exhaustive list, but the words and phrases we've focused on are the ones students are most likely to encounter in texts and literature. Consider giving students a copy of

Appendix C to refer to when they are revising. 

**Introducing the Unelaborated Paragraph**

We often notice that students can apply TWR techniques when a teacher provides them with structure, but then have difficulty when writing independently. This issue usually emerges when students revise their drafts. A student might, for example, improve a sentence by adding an appositive when you specifically suggest that strategy, but he won't come up with the idea on his own. 

An effective way to solve this problem and see improvement in students’ independent writing is by using the **unelaborated paragraph**. Students may be reluctant to change their own writing after they've already invested some effort in getting it down on paper. They may be far more likely to practice revision strategies on a piece of writing composed by someone else. 

**WHY PRACTICE REVISING UNELABORATED PARAGRAPHS? **

Helps students learn to use TWR strategies with careful scaffolding and then apply them to their own writing independently Enables them to practice revision techniques on text for which they don't feel a sense of ownership

Deepens their understanding of content

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

The idea is to give students a bare-bones paragraph consisting of four to six simple sentences and then guide them through the process of improving it. 

**Unelaborated paragraphs should have no errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, or grammar so that students can focus** **on revision, not editing. **

To enrich and expand the sentences and make the paragraph flow, students will be drawing on the sentence-level strategies they've learned, including their knowledge of transitions, and getting practice in using varied vocabulary. Your directions to students for revising the paragraph should draw only on skills that you have explicitly taught them. 

As with all TWR activities, introduce the unelaborated paragraph as a whole-class activity, under your guidance. Ideally, it should be embedded in content students have studied. If that's not possible, choose a subject students know well. If they don't have a command of the subject, students won't be able to provide the details they'll need to improve and expand the paragraph. 

Here is a Level 1 example of what it might look like as students revise an unelaborated paragraph. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Gold used the following unelaborated paragraph with her Level 1 students about the class's trip to the aquarium: The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch. The bus ride was fun. It was a very good field trip! 

“This is a pretty boring paragraph, isn't it?” Ms. Gold asked after posting the paragraph in her classroom, and the students agreed. “Let's see if we can make it more interesting. *When did we go to the aquarium?” *

“Last week!” the students called out. Ms. Gold added the words *Last week* to the beginning of the first sentence. 

“Okay, great!” Ms. Gold said. “But what about this next sentence? *What* could we add to that?” 

“We could say, *we saw many different sea creatures, *” a student offered. 

“That's a good idea. What about the next sentence? *When* did we eat lunch? *Where* did we eat lunch?” 

As she made her way through the paragraph, Ms. Gold continued the process of asking questions and adding students’ responses to the board. Other questions she asked included the following:

“Why was the bus ride fun?” 

“Can we think of a better word than *good* in the last sentence?” 

After this, she gave the students a worksheet that reflected her discussion with the class about how to revise the unelaborated paragraph. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow. 

The third grade went to the aquarium. We saw lots of fish. We had lunch. The bus ride was fun. It was a very good field trip. 

1. Expand T.S. (when?)

2. Sentence 2: Vary vocabulary, be specific (lots, fish)

3. Sentence 3: Expand (when? where?)

4. Sentence 4: Vary vocabulary (fun)

5. Sentence 4: Expand (why?)

6. C.S.: Vary vocabulary (good)

***Last week, the third grade went to the aquarium. We saw fantastic sea creatures such as dolphins. Later, we had lunch***

***outside at the picnic tables*****. The bus ride back to school was great because we had snacks and talked to our friends. It was** **a wonderful field trip! **

More experienced writers will be able to improve unelaborated paragraphs with less scaffolding. But don't stop giving such students unelaborated paragraphs because you think they're too easy! They continue to be an extremely effective activity even for high school students as a check of comprehension and as an opportunity to practice revision. 

**Level 2 Example**

Here is an example of a Level 2 activity. The class was studying the accomplishments of famous women in American history. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Revise the paragraph using the directions that follow. 

Eleanor Roosevelt was important. She was married to Franklin Roosevelt. She was the First Lady from 1933 to 1945. She made many contributions. Many people admired her. 

1. Improve T.S. and C.S. 5. Vary vocabulary

2. Expand sentences

6. Use an appositive

3. Use transitions

7. Give examples

4. Combine sentences

8. Use a subordinating conjunction

***Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most admired women of the 20th century, was the wife of President Franklin Delano***

***Roosevelt and First Lady from 1933 to 1945. Although she was born into great wealth and privilege, she was extremely***

***aware of the injustices suffered by those less fortunate. She became a passionate advocate for human rights, and is***

***remembered as an author and activist. After FDR's death, President Harry Truman appointed her as a delegate to the***

***United Nations, where she gained worldwide respect and received many honors and awards for her achievements. ***

***Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt the “First Lady of the World.” ***

In composing this informative and smoothly flowing paragraph, students are demonstrating their ability to create sophisticated sentences and a sense of organization. At the same time, they are drawing on and deepening their knowledge of the topic. 

**Differentiating Unelaborated Paragraph Activities**

Provide all students with the same bare-bones paragraph, but give some students fewer instructions for revision. For example, give some students a list of six things to do and limit others to only one or two. 

Make directions explicit as opposed to general. For example:

*Explicit*: Use an appositive in the T.S. 

*General*: Improve T.S. 

*Explicit*: Add *where* to the fourth sentence. 

*General:* Expand sentences. 

**Moving from Unelaborated Paragraphs to Independent Revision**

The main goal of giving students unelaborated paragraphs is to enable them to make similar revisions in their own writing without a teacher's prompting. 

The following steps will lead students to that goal:

1. Revise an unelaborated paragraph as a class. 

2. Give students an unelaborated paragraph with explicit directions and have them work in pairs, small groups, or independently. 

3. Have students revise an unelaborated paragraph, without directions, independently, in pairs, or with a small group. 

4. Have students revise their own work after getting teacher feedback that reflects the language used in TWR strategies and activities—for example, 

“add a transition.” 

5. Have students revise their own work independently, using the techniques they have practiced. 

As your students become accustomed to revising their writing, encourage them to revise their drafts more than once. In fact, point out that in most cases, the better the writer, the more times she will rework a draft. 

**It's important to note that many lessons can end after revisions and edits**. A polished final copy of a paragraph or composition is not necessary to achieve the lesson's objectives. 

Generally, introductory revision assignments should be kept brief. It's best for Level 1 writers to limit their revisions to one paragraph of five or six sentences. That's also true for more able writers who are still learning how to make substantive revisions. If students write at greater length, they may find it difficult to revise and edit and become discouraged. **Clarity and accuracy, not length, are the goals. **

When students are writing by hand, stress that they should leave room on their papers for revising and editing their drafts by skipping lines. If students are using a computer, they should double or triple space for the same reason. For drafting and revising written work and printing final copies, computers are invaluable—as long as students learn keyboarding skills and become proficient typists. If they have to hunt and peck at a keyboard, students will be distracted during the complex process of composing. 

**Giving Students Feedback**

Feedback on drafts should be tailored to an individual student's level of proficiency. When your students are writing drafts, they may write sentences that need to be expanded. With Level 1 students, your feedback should be explicit. For example, you might insert *when? * or *why? * at specific points in their writing. With Level 2 students, you will be able to just write *expand* on their work. That should encourage them to consult the question word chart you've posted on the wall, which can help them determine which of the question words are relevant to their sentences. 

After being taught how to construct sentences, craft SPOs, and use transitions, students should be able to understand the following notes and abbreviations. This kind of feedback is far more helpful than just saying “make it better” or “add more details” and hoping for the best. 

**BRIEF BUT TARGETED FEEDBACK**

**when? why? ** [expand this point]

**ext w/ so →** [extend with *so*]

**ex. ** [provide an example]

**app. in T.S. ** [use an appositive in topic sentence]





**insert transition**

**sub. conj. in C.S. ** [begin concluding sentence with a subordinating conjunction]

**combine sent. 2 & 3**

A teacher might also point out, more generally, places where a student got off track, using words like:

repetitive

irrelevant

Exhibit 7.3 is an example of feedback included directly on the draft. 

**Exhibit 7.3**

**Editing: Last but Not Least**

Once students have a final draft, it's time to proofread—that is, check for errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. Many students, especially those at Level 1, will need help spotting those errors and correcting them. 

As we discussed in Chapter 1, researchers have unanimously concluded that teaching grammar rules in isolation doesn't work for most students. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't teach grammar. What *does* work is to teach grammar—along with writing conventions such as spelling and punctuation—in the context of the activities students are assigned or do in class. 

In Chapters 2 and 4, we pointed out that it's best, whenever possible, to teach grammar and conventions in the context of sentence-level work, where

the number of errors is likely to be more manageable than in lengthier student writing. But even if you've done that, most students will continue to make at least some mechanical errors when they move on to paragraphs and compositions—although perhaps not as many as they would have otherwise. To give your students the skills that will enable them to avoid distracting readers with technical mistakes, continue to identify and correct these errors in your students’ drafts. 

**Saving Time with Proofreading Symbols**

If you familiarize your students with standard proofreading symbols, such as a caret (˄) to indicate an insertion, you'll be able to use those symbols to

give quick and specific feedback on their writing during both the revision and editing stages. (You'll find a list of proofreading symbols in Appendix

D.) If you simply circle a grammatical error such as a lack of subject-verb agreement, there's a good chance the student won't understand what the

problem is. 

**RESOURCE**

Proofreading Symbols  *Appendix D*

Take the time to make sure students know what mistakes they've made and that they know how to correct them. There's no other way to ensure that they'll learn the rules. Using symbols to communicate precisely what the error is will make the revision and editing process much more efficient. 

Busy teachers often have difficulty finding the time to provide detailed feedback on students’ writing. But if you've laid the groundwork, you can provide shorthand feedback fairly quickly. And students will not only understand your abbreviations but also know how to follow through on the suggestions you've given them. 

**RESOURCE**

Student Revise and Edit Checklist  *Appendix E*

When students become more adept at revision, you may want to provide them with the “Student Revise and Edit Checklist” in Appendix E, adapting

it as necessary to your students’ needs and level of ability. Students can then go through the checklist on their own and ensure that their paragraphs and compositions are the best they can be. 

**To Sum Up**

Revising, or making structural improvements to a draft, should be done before editing, which consists primarily of correcting mechanical errors. 

To help students revise their drafts, remind them to use sentence expansion, sentence types, subordinating conjunctions, appositives, and sentence-combining to vary their sentence structure. 

Encourage students to use vivid and precise words in the revision process. 

Transition words signal the connections between sentences and ideas and create smoothly flowing prose. 

Before students try to revise their own writing, have them practice on unelaborated paragraphs that you provide. 

Use proofreading symbols and abbreviations for TWR strategies so feedback is explicit and brief.
