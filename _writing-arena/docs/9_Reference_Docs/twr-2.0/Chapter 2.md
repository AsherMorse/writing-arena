## CHAPTER 2

### **Sentences: Learning the Fundamentals**

When I was teaching third grade, I would routinely assign paragraphs and essays. Students would write at length, but they almost always included phrases that they clearly thought were sentences and in fact were not. They seemed to believe phrases qualified as complete sentences if they put a capital at the beginning and a period at the end. 

I was surprised that students had made it to third grade without having grasped the concept of a complete sentence—and I wasn't sure how to get the concept across in a way that translated into their writing. I didn't realize that my attempts at writing instruction were like trying to build a house starting with the roof. 

Little did I know then that it's not just third graders who often haven't yet learned how to distinguish between a complete, coherent sentence and a group of words that doesn't express a complete thought—or, at the other extreme, a group of words that goes on beyond the boundaries of what a sentence should be. Many high school students also haven't acquired that knowledge, through no fault of their own. 

If you want your students to write good paragraphs and compositions, you need to start building a solid foundation first—just the way you would start building a house. In writing, that foundation consists of sentences. 

The importance of spending plenty of instructional time working with sentences can't be stressed enough. Students need to move from writing the way they speak to using the structures of written language. At one high-poverty high school, students' writing quality improved dramatically after

just four months of instruction in TWR sentence strategies.1

Once students begin to construct more sophisticated sentences, they'll enhance not only their writing skills but also their reading comprehension. 2 In addition, sentence-level work will lay the groundwork for your students' ability to revise and edit when they tackle longer forms of writing. 

To understand the value of sentence-level work, it helps to think about the concept of working memory—the aspect of our consciousness that takes in and tries to make sense of new information. As we've mentioned, the capacity of working memory is extremely limited, and writing imposes a heavy burden on it. Scientists refer to that kind of burden as **cognitive load**. If students are trying to juggle too many new things in working memory at the same time, the resulting cognitive load can prevent them from learning to write well and from understanding, analyzing, and retaining the content they're writing about. The most effective way to modulate that cognitive load is to begin writing instruction at the sentence level—and to provide built-in guardrails that help focus students' attention on what we want them to absorb. 

If students are unfamiliar with the topic they're trying to write about, that adds to cognitive load. That's why it's important to introduce new writing strategies, including sentence-level ones, in the context of familiar material, freeing up cognitive capacity for understanding and retaining the strategies. 

It's also important to bear in mind that different aspects of literacy impose different levels of cognitive load. Listening and speaking—which are components of literacy—don't in themselves impose any cognitive load because humans have evolved to do those things naturally. Reading and—

especially—writing, on the other hand, can impose heavy cognitive loads. That's why it's important to model new strategies and have students practice them initially as a whole class, with the teacher's guidance. 

At the same time, the concept of cognitive load helps explain how sentence-level work lays the crucial foundation for writing at length. As we mentioned, if you have knowledge of the topic you're writing about, that will lessen your cognitive load. But it's also important to have knowledge of how to do things like vary your sentence structure or use certain words to connect your thoughts. When students acquire that kind of knowledge through repeated practice with sentence-level activities, they have more cognitive capacity available for the many other aspects of writing that come into play when they're writing at length. 

Another benefit of sentence-level instruction is that it can familiarize students with the complex syntax of written language. Reading complex text aloud to students and ensuring they're hearing the sentences can help—but it's even more powerful to teach students how to use those structures in their own writing. 

Almost all the sentence-level strategies described in this book build and deepen knowledge. In fact, they do that even more effectively than lengthier writing assignments for inexperienced or struggling writers, who may be so overwhelmed by the mechanical demands of writing that they lack the capacity to focus on the meaning of what they're trying to write about. 

Sentence-level work can also enable students to construct sentences that are informative, complex, and interesting. Many students, when asked to compose a sentence, may write something like this:

*He led the Salt March*. 

The goal of TWR sentence-level strategies and the activities that support them is to enable students to write something more like this: *In 1930, Gandhi, a political and spiritual leader, led the Salt March to protest Great Britain's tax policies*. 

The second sentence has an **appositive** and is expanded to answer the questions *who*, *when*, and *why*. If you teach all these elements explicitly through TWR sentence-level strategies, your students will be able to construct far more sophisticated and informative responses. The second sentence also demonstrates far more content knowledge than the first one. 

In this chapter, we'll describe activities that help students understand some basic sentence-level concepts. In later chapters, we'll cover activities that help students learn to craft more complex sentences. 

**What Makes a Sentence a Sentence? Correcting Fragments, Scrambled Sentences, and Run-Ons**

**WHY PRACTICE SENTENCE-DEFINING AND WORD-ORDERING? **

Helps students understand the concept of a complete sentence and discern sentence boundaries

Helps students understand correct word order

Provides practice with capitalization, punctuation, and using new spelling and vocabulary words

Can serve as a comprehension check

Helps more proficient students understand the meanings of subjects, predicates, and prepositional phrases

Encourages careful reading and proofreading

A sentence consists of a group of words that includes a **subject** and a **predicate** and expresses a complete thought. Younger students and those who haven't yet developed good writing skills often struggle with the concept of a complete sentence. Everyone uses sentence fragments or incomplete sentences in spoken language, and students may continue to use them as they learn to write. 

A **fragment** is a group of words that is not a grammatically complete sentence. Usually a fragment lacks a subject, verb, or both (e.g., “went shopping” or “to the store”), or it is a dependent clause that is not connected to an independent clause (e.g., “After I do my homework”). 

As we mentioned earlier, simply giving students these definitions isn't likely to help them write complete sentences. For many students, definitions are too abstract. They need to spend time hearing and reading complete sentences alongside sentence fragments and distinguishing between the two. 

Teachers also need to ask their students questions about fragments that will guide them to turn the fragments into complete sentences. 

When you introduce your students to the concept of a complete sentence as opposed to a fragment, explain that while fragments may be fine in conversation, writing requires more precision. Help students understand that need for precision by giving them examples of sentence fragments and asking them what element is missing. Your students may need a lot of practice working with examples you provide before they can recognize fragments in their own writing. 

**Laying the Groundwork: Fixing Fragments Orally**

Initially, when you give examples of fragments, it's best to present them orally rather than in writing. For example, you might say to the class: *ran to the park*

With Level 1 students, avoid using technical grammatical terms such as *subject* and *predicate*, which may just confuse them. To guide them to supply a subject, you could ask, “Does that tell us *who* ran to the park? We need to know how to make these words into a complete sentence.” 

If you're teaching Level 2 students, you might say, “The subject (or predicate) is missing in this fragment. Can you make it into a complete sentence?” 

Another example could be:

*Sam and Dan*

You might say, “We need to know *what they did*. Let's make this fragment into a complete sentence.” Students would then supply a verb (such as *ran*) and perhaps a predicate ( *ran to the park*) to create a sentence. 

If you give your students examples of fragments orally that are related to the content they're studying, it will have the added advantage of deepening their knowledge of the content. These examples can be more or less challenging, depending on the complexity of the content and the knowledge demands of the fragment you choose to give them. 

When you make up fragments, it's important to *anticipate the correct responses* and be sure that your students have the knowledge they need to repair them. When they retrieve that knowledge, they'll be further reinforcing it in long-term memory. 

**Level 1 Example**

If you've been teaching your students about the civil rights movement, and you're not sure of their grasp of the material, you might give them this fragment:

*helped organize freedom summer*

Your students could then draw on the content they've learned to turn the fragment into a sentence, such as the following: *Fannie Lou Hamer helped organize Freedom Summer*. 

**Level 2 Example**

If you're teaching a class on World War I and you want to assess what your students learned about the long-term impact of the Treaty of Versailles, you might give them this fragment:

*contributed to the rise of fascist regimes*

Your students may respond with the following:

*The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles contributed to the rise of fascist regimes*. 



**Writing Activities with Fragments**

Once your students know how to distinguish fragments from sentences through oral practice, have them practice with written examples. 

**Fragments or Sentences? **

Begin by giving your students a list that includes fragments and complete sentences, and tell them to mark the sentences with an *S* and the fragments with an *F*. Have them add correct capitalization and punctuation to the sentences. They should then convert the fragments into complete sentences with appropriate capitalization and punctuation. **When creating the list, be careful not to capitalize or punctuate either the fragments** **or the sentences. **

If you've been teaching your students about Greek mythology, you could give them a list such as the following. After marking these examples *F* or *S,* students should convert the fragments into sentences and add the correct punctuation and capitalization to the sentences. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write *S* if the words form a complete sentence. Capitalize and punctuate the sentences. Write *F* if the words are a sentence fragment. Change the fragments into sentences with correct capitalization and punctuation. 

1. ***F*** built a labyrinth for king minos

***Daedalus built a labyrinth for King Minos. ***

2. ***F*** daedalus and his son

***Daedalus and his son were imprisoned by King Minos of Crete. ***

3. ***S*** icarus was excited to be free

***Icarus was excited to be free. ***

4. ***F*** destroyed icarus's wings

***The heat of the sun destroyed Icarus's wings. ***

**Changing Fragments to Sentences**

A science teacher might want to review the periodic table and also help students reinforce their understanding of sentences. She might give them the following two fragments and ask them to change them into sentences with proper punctuation and capitalization:

**DIRECTIONS:** Change the fragments to complete sentences, adding correct capitalization and punctuation. 

1. the periodic table

***The periodic table is an organized array of elements. ***

2. has atomic number 56

3. ***Barium has atomic number 56. ***

**BE CAREFUL**

Keep the following points in mind when you're creating sentence fragment activities for your students:

Don't capitalize or punctuate either the fragments or the sentences. For example, give students the fragment “beyond the forest” rather than “Beyond the forest.” Give them the sentence “beyond the forest there was a clearing” rather than “Beyond the forest, there was a clearing.” Capitalizing and punctuating only the sentences would give away which examples are which! 

Be careful not to use commands (e.g., “run quickly”) when you're giving students examples of fragments. Commands can be complete sentences. If you're not sure whether an example could be a command, try doing the “please” test: if you can put “please” in front of it and have it make sense, it's a command. 

Avoid using kernel sentences (e.g., “they argued”) as examples of fragments because they are complete sentences. 

If you give students a fragment that you intend to be a subject, don't include a verb (e.g., “Nelson Mandela was”). 

If you give students a fragment that you intend to be a predicate, include the verb (e.g., “was the mythological founder of Rome”). 

Start with fragments that just have subjects or predicates; hold off on using prepositional phrases (“on the ship”) or dependent clauses (“after the study was published”). 

Make sure your students already have been exposed to the information they will need to complete sentence fragments. 

Don't just lift a fragment directly from a sentence in a text students have read. That would turn the activity into a fill-in-the-blank exercise rather than one that requires them to retrieve information and put it in their own words. 

Before creating a fragment, first create the anticipated response you would like students to develop from the fragment. 

**Differentiating Fragment Activities**

If some of your students need extra support:

Capitalize the proper nouns. 

Use only subjects and predicates as fragments initially. 



**Solve the Puzzle: Unscrambling Scrambled Sentences**

Rearranging jumbled groups of words into coherent sentences helps students grasp several fundamental concepts: the nature of a complete sentence, the order in which words should be sequenced, and the rules of punctuation and capitalization. When the activity is embedded in curriculum content, students also will be deepening their understanding of that content and of new vocabulary words they've learned. 

Scrambled sentences can include statements, questions, and exclamations, but should *avoid commands*. With commands—such as “Get the book”—

the subject ( *you*) is implied rather than stated explicitly, and that can be confusing. 

Use between four and six words per sentence for Level 1 students and between seven and ten words for Level 2 students. As with fragment activities, you should generally not include any capitalization or punctuation in your scrambled groups of words. 

Here are some examples of scrambled sentences with anticipated student responses. In the Level 1 examples, we've put the first word in bold as an example of how you can help students who need more support. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Rearrange the words into sentences. Add the correct capitalization and punctuation. 

1. salt contain water **oceans**

***Oceans contain salt water. ***

2. are continents **there** seven

***There are seven continents. ***

**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Rearrange the words into sentences. Add the correct capitalization and punctuation. 

1. river land around belonged the mississippi to france

***Land around the Mississippi River belonged to France. ***

2. louisiana cost the dollars purchase million fifteen

***The Louisiana Purchase cost fifteen million dollars. ***

**BE CAREFUL**

Keep the following points in mind when you're creating scrambled sentence activities for your students:

Avoid too many function words ( *the*, *an*, and so on) when creating scrambled sentences. 

Make sure that the number of words in student-facing material is equal to the number of words in the anticipated response. 

There should be only one correct way to arrange the scrambled words. 

**Differentiating Scrambled Sentence Activities**

For Level 1 students who need additional support:

Capitalize proper nouns. 

Write the first word in bold letters. 

**Put the Brakes On: Correcting Run-On Sentences**

**Run-on sentences** are seen frequently in student writing. There's no quick solution, but there are a few effective ways to help students become aware of run-ons and learn how to correct them. 

Try putting a run-on sentence on the board daily, preferably embedded in content or relating to a subject students have already learned about. First, ask a student to read the sentence aloud, without pausing, and then ask the class what's wrong with it. After doing this a few times, you can just put run-ons on the board and have students correct them without hearing them read aloud. Continue to do this as a daily warm-up activity until students start correcting them in their writing. 

For example, if you are reading *Bridge to Terabithia*3, you could give students the following run-on sentence to correct: *Leslie showed Jess the kingdom of Terabithia, it was a magical place in the woods where they could be themselves, they were king and queen of* *this land, it was their escape from the real world*. 

If the word *and* is the biggest culprit in the run-ons your students write, tell them to go back and look at every *and* they've put into a sentence. Then have them ask themselves whether they're joining two ideas that should be in separate sentences. 

Another technique that could help is to give students a list of sentences, some of which are run-ons. Have them identify the run-ons and divide them into sentences. 

**To Sum Up**

Embed sentence activities in the content you're teaching as much as possible to check students' comprehension and deepen their understanding. 

Use sentence activities to teach grammar and conventions. 

When introducing a new activity, begin by modeling it and having students practice it orally. 

Have students practice activities with sentence fragments, scrambled sentences, and run-on sentences to help them grasp the concept of a complete sentence. 

When assigning sentence fragments, be sure that students have the information they need to turn the fragments into complete sentences.
