## CHAPTER 10

**Taking a Stand: Writing Opinion, Pro/Con, and Argumentative Essays**

Ms. Giannelli was familiar with the state writing standards that applied to her seventh graders. She knew they needed to be able to write arguments in which they supported their claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence, while acknowledging another point of view. 

After searching online for argumentative writing prompts, Ms. Giannelli found a wealth of ideas for middle schoolers. She decided to give her class a choice of just three topics:

Should cell phones be allowed at school? 

Should students have homework on weekends? 

Should exotic animals be kept in captivity? 

Ms. Giannelli knew her students had lots of opinions on the first two questions, and she suspected the third one would appeal to the animal lovers in the class. To help them get started on a topic they might not know much about, she provided the two sentences that had accompanied the prompt online: “Many exotic animals live longer in captivity. However, many people argue that it's not a good way of life for them.” 

Ms. Giannelli was pleased to see that as students chose their topics, there was a buzz of excitement in the air. After about half an hour, she decided to check their progress. 

Some students seemed to have gotten stuck after the first sentence or two—especially those who had chosen to write about animals in captivity. Most were against the idea, but they had trouble coming up with reasons beyond their conviction that the animals would be unhappy. 

Students who chose one of the other topics had produced more prose, but it wasn't what Ms. Giannelli had hoped for. Ari's essay was pretty typical. She took a strong stand against homework on weekends. But her reasons were entirely personal. She explained how tired she was after school on Fridays and listed all the activities she would like to engage in during a typical weekend. Ms. Giannelli didn't think these reasons counted as “evidence.” Nor did Ari acknowledge that anyone else might think homework on weekends was a good idea, let alone raise the arguments such a person might make and try to rebut them. 

The standards were clear, and it was equally clear Ms. Giannelli's students weren't equipped to meet them. What wasn't clear was what she could do about that. 

Teachers frequently assign opinion and argumentative essays to satisfy the requirements of state writing standards. Children as young as third grade are expected to present their claims and convince a reader of their point of view. By sixth grade, they're supposed to be supporting their claims with evidence, and by seventh grade they should be acknowledging arguments on the other side. As we have discovered, even older students often struggle to write these kinds of essays if they haven't learned the appropriate language and structures. 

When you have students practice the skills leading up to argumentative writing, choose a topic that has two debatable sides. Whenever possible, the topic should be embedded in the content students are studying. Often opinion or argumentative writing is treated as a separate category that can be addressed only by having students take and defend positions on topics beyond the school curriculum—such as the pros and cons of school uniforms. 

However, choosing a topic they've been studying is an ideal way to build and deepen their knowledge of content. Stay alert for topics in the curriculum, at whatever grade level you're teaching, that lend themselves to pro/con writing. For example, students can write about the pros and cons of traveling west in covered wagons, the strengths and weaknesses or flaws in a particular book or character, or arguments for and against using atomic bombs to attack Japan in World War II. 

If you've been using TWR's method, your students have already been building the skills they'll need to craft effective arguments: Completing sentence stems using *because*, *but*, and *so* develops students' ability to connect a **claim** to evidence, introduce a **counterclaim,** and describe cause/effect relationships. 

Using subordinating conjunctions such as *while* and *although* and transitions such as *however* and *on the other hand* to begin sentences enables students to acknowledge or make a claim while simultaneously bringing in an opposing claim. 

Sentence expansion using a kernel that takes a position develops students' ability to state a claim. 

Transitions present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims. 

Creating topic sentences and thesis statements enables students to identify the main points they want to make in an argument. 

Summarizing develops students' ability to succinctly describe claims on both sides. 

Creating Single-Paragraph Outlines (SPOs that are either pro or con), Transition Outlines (TOs), and Multiple-Paragraph Outlines (MPOs) helps students logically organize claims and evidence. 

Incorporating quotations and paraphrases during the revision process teaches students how to cite evidence for claims in an effective way. 

As we emphasize throughout this book, however, these strategies will help students write well only if they have knowledge of what they're writing about. That applies to argumentative writing as much as to any other genre. 

**Preparing for Argumentative Writing**

Often students approach argumentative writing by progressing along three types of paragraphs and compositions:

**Opinion:** Author tries to convince a reader to adopt a certain point of view; opinion writing is the easiest and is generally assigned to elementary students. 

**Pro/con:** Author lays out two sides of an issue and presents the evidence to support each side but doesn't take a position. 

**Argumentative:** Author presents the evidence for both sides but also decides which position has more merit and defends the one he supports. 

Opinion and pro/con writing assignments constitute a scaffold leading to the argumentative essay—the most challenging of these three types of writing. In writing opinion pieces, younger students get practice listing reasons that support a claim. When crafting body paragraphs of a pro/con essay, students learn to state opposing positions and present evidence that supports each one. If they actually agree with one side rather than the other, they get practice suspending their own opinions and putting themselves in the shoes of someone on the other side—a skill that will serve them well when they turn to argumentative writing and need to summarize an opposing viewpoint fairly. 

**WHY PRACTICE WRITING OPINION, PRO/CON, AND ARGUMENTATIVE PIECES? **

Develops analytical and logical thinking skills

Helps students distinguish reliable sources from unreliable ones

Improves organizational skills

Teaches students to cite textual evidence effectively

Develops the ability to assess and rank stronger and weaker arguments

Reinforces academic knowledge and vocabulary

Planning and outlining before writing a draft of any of these essay types deepens and reinforces students' understanding of content. Moreover, as with other outline strategies, these benefits will accrue whether or not students create a finished product. 

**Sentence‐Level Activities: Laying the Foundation for Arguments**

To prepare your students for the challenges of writing argumentative essays, you can give them sentence-level activities that will introduce some of the techniques they'll ultimately use for that type of writing. The conjunction, transition, and sentence expansion activities that follow will also deepen students' comprehension of the curriculum content in which they're embedded and spur them to think analytically about what they've learned. 

**Using Conjunctions to Present a Position**

The following examples illustrate how conjunction activities can introduce students to the idea of identifying evidence that supports claims. 

When students use *because*, they need to find evidence that supports the proposition given in the sentence stem. When they use *so*, they need to consider what action people should take as a result of that evidence. As always, using the conjunction *but* may be more challenging because students need to come up with opposing evidence—laying the foundation for pro/con, and, eventually, argumentative writing. 

**Level 1 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Weather forecasts can be helpful because ***people need to prepare for different conditions***. 

Weather forecasts can be helpful, but ***they are not always accurate*****. **

Weather forecasts can be helpful, so ***it is important to check them regularly*****. **



**Level 2 Example**

**DIRECTIONS:** Complete the following sentence stems. 

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture because ***they can be engineered to resist pests, tolerate***

***harsh conditions, and increase crop yields*****. **

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, but ***there are concerns about their impact on biodiversity, ***

***their potential health risks, and the ethics of genetic manipulation*****. **

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be used in agriculture, so ***it's important to conduct ongoing research and establish***

***regulations to ensure their safe and responsible use*****. **

**Using Transitions to Introduce and Support Claims**

A transition may begin a sentence, thus creating a link between that sentence and the one that precedes it, or link thoughts within a sentence. When used at the beginning or end of a paragraph, transitions can underscore a theme or idea that knits the paragraph's various sentences together. And, of course, transitions can and should be used judiciously to connect the paragraphs in a multiple-paragraph essay. These functions are explained in more detail in Chapter 9. 

**RESOURCE**

Transition Words and Phrases *Appendix C*

All five categories of transition words and phrases can be helpful in presenting and evaluating reasons, evidence, and claims (see Appendix C). 

Students can learn to use the following types of transitions:

**Time-and-sequence** transitions such as *in addition*, *moreover*, and *finally* to list reasons and claims on each side **Illustration** transitions such as *for example* and *specifically* to provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence **Emphasis** transitions such as *most important*, *moreover*, or *certainly* to highlight the most important claims or underscore an argument **Change-of-direction** transitions such as *however*, *although*, and *in contrast* to introduce or acknowledge opposing claims **Conclusion** transitions such as *thus* or *in the end* to signal that they're wrapping up an argument Change-of-direction transitions are particularly useful for introducing a contrasting point, example, or argument. They can come in the middle of sentences, as with *but*, or at the beginning of a new sentence, as with *however*. When one paragraph is devoted to a claim and the next to a counterclaim, tell your students they can introduce the second paragraph with a change-of-direction transition such as *on the other hand*. 

Another type of change-of-direction transition—the subordinating conjunction—is particularly useful for thesis statements in pro/con or argumentative essays. If students begin their thesis statements with words such as *although* and *while*, they'll be able to acknowledge two opposing claims. They'll also be able to avoid using the first person ( *I believe*), which can detract from the authority of their argument. 

**Using Sentence Expansion to Build Argumentative Skills**

Another sentence-level activity that can be adapted to build argumentative skills is sentence expansion. Remember that sentence expansion involves giving students a kernel sentence—a simple, active, declarative sentence with only one verb—along with the question words to help them expand it. 

To make sentence expansion into an argumentative activity, make the kernel sentence you give students one that takes a position. This example is embedded in content from the book *Flowers for Algernon*:1

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 



His life greatly improved. 



Who? ***Charlie***

When? ***after experimental surgery***

Why? ***intelligence***** ↑**



**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After the experimental surgery, Charlie's life greatly improved because his intelligence***

***increased*****. **

Then you might also give them a kernel that takes the opposite position. For example:

**DIRECTIONS:** Expand the kernel sentence. 



His quality of life declined. 



Who? ***Charlie***

When? ***after experimental surgery***

Why? ***lost friends → lonely***



**EXPANDED SENTENCE:** ***After the experimental surgery, Charlie's quality of life declined because he lost his friends and***

***became lonely*****. **

**Using Sentence‐Level Activities Together**

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole's second-grade class had been reading about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping animals in zoos as opposed to their natural habitats. To help students understand the debate and work on their writing skills, Ms. Cole gave them sentence stems that required them to supply a logical or evidence-based reason to support the pro-zoo side and explain what followed from that position:

Zoos are good for animals because ***they protect endangered species from extinction*****. **

Zoos are good for animals, so ***people should continue to support them*****. **

Since many zoos educate visitors about conservation, ***people learn to respect the environment*****. **

Then she made the activity more challenging by asking them to consider arguments on the other side:

Zoos are not good for animals because ***animals should not be removed from their native habitats*****. **

Zoos are not good for animals, so ***they should not be supported by the public*****. **

Since many zoos keep animals in unsafe conditions, ***animals develop health problems*****. **

Finally, Ms. Cole asked her students to summarize both positions without taking a side:

Although some people believe that zoos help certain species survive, ***others argue that animals should not be held captive*****. **

Next Ms. Cole wanted her students to practice using transition words between sentences. Although the students weren't yet ready to write pro/con paragraphs about zoos, she wanted them to have experience creating the kinds of connections between thoughts that they would need to use during the drafting and revising stages. 

Ms. Cole gave her students pairs of sentences that had no transition words connecting them. The students needed to choose an appropriate transition word for each pair and write it in the blank. To provide additional support, Ms. Cole provided a word bank of transition words for her students to choose from. Initially, she gave them sentences that only required them to take one side, either pro or con, like this: If zoos are closed, many animal species may become extinct. 

***For example, *** the numbers of wild gorillas and elephants have decreased because of poachers. 



Zoos have improved over the years. ***As a result, *** animals live longer in them and are healthier. 

Then she introduced transitions that required students to offer contrasting evidence, laying the groundwork for pro/con and argumentative writing: Some people believe zoos can be good for animals. On the other hand, ***critics say that animals have better lives in the wild*****. **

**Level 2 Example**

When his Level 2 history class was studying the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Hidalgo gave them the following sentence stems to develop their argumentative writing skills:

Theodore Roosevelt has many admirers because ***he established national parks and expanded national forests*****. **

Mr. Hidalgo then made the activity more challenging by introducing stems that required students to consider both pro and con considerations, such as this one:

Although Theodore Roosevelt moved the United States toward becoming a world power, ***critics argue that Roosevelt had imperialistic***

***tendencies, particularly in his approach to foreign affairs*****. **

He also had students complete stems in a way that took a position to help them distinguish between pro/con writing and argumentative writing, and to prepare them for the latter:

While critics of Theodore Roosevelt point to his use of military interventions and limited action on civil rights, ***his accomplishments in***

***conservation, foreign affairs, and support of workers' rights are outstanding legacies*****. **

Mr. Hidalgo had students supply transition words to link sentences about Roosevelt's administration. But because his Level 2 students were more experienced writers, he had them come up with their own transition words rather than giving them a word bank to choose from: Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. ***Consequently, *** he was criticized for interfering in the internal affairs of another country. 

Alternatively, Mr. Hidalgo could have given students the transition and had them complete the sentence:

Theodore Roosevelt supported a rebellion in Panama against Colombia. Consequently, ***he was criticized for interfering in the internal***

***affairs of another country***. 

**Opinion Writing**

Opinion writing is the least demanding type of writing in this genre because students can present one point of view without bringing in arguments on the other side. For Level 1 writers, an opinion piece can consist of just one paragraph. However, they must do more than simply state their opinions. 

They need to back up their opinions with reasons, although their reasons can be based on personal experience rather than evidence. 

For example, a student might write an opinion piece arguing that dogs make better pets than cats. She might talk about how loyal, affectionate, and obedient her own dog is. She wouldn't need to bring in and evaluate arguments against dogs (they need to be walked) or in favor of cats (they keep themselves clean). 

**Fact versus Opinion: Introducing the Distinction**

It's important for students to develop an understanding of the difference between opinion and fact because opinions won't be enough to support their arguments later on when they're writing pro/con or argumentative essays. They'll need evidence. 

You can start introducing students to the fact/opinion distinction in the early elementary grades. In one of our partner schools, for example, a first-grade teacher had her class collectively plan an opinion paragraph explaining why a lot of children love summer. As they came up with a topic sentence and details for the body, the teacher listed the latter in note form on a whiteboard. Then she guided them through the process of coming up with a concluding sentence, producing an outline that looked something like this:

T.S. ***A lot of students love summer*****. **





1. ***no school or homework***

2. ***swimming***

3. ***more time outside***

4. ***longer days***



C.S. ***Summer is the best time of the year! ***



During this kind of activity, a teacher can point out that the concluding sentence is an opinion, and the details on the numbered lines are facts that support it. 

Some topics don't lend themselves to reasons beyond the author's personal experience. If you ask your students to write an opinion piece about what the best holiday is, they're probably going to list the reasons *they* like Christmas or Thanksgiving. To help your students develop the skills that will help them write argumentative essays, you'll need to choose topics that lend themselves to reasoned debate, based on facts. **Your students will** **need to have factual information they can draw on to support their opinions. **

**Pro/Con Writing**

Level 2 students may be able to go straight to pro/con compositions, which are a significant step up from opinion pieces. Each body paragraph in the essay presents one side of an issue and the evidence that supports it. A student might write a pro paragraph explaining that the ambition of Alexander the Great was a positive trait because he brought the benefits of Greek civilization to other lands. Then the student could write a con paragraph that it was a negative trait because Alexander's conquest of foreign lands caused so much suffering. 

A pro/con essay has an introduction and a conclusion, but—unlike in an argumentative essay—students take a neutral stance, simply presenting the claims and evidence on each side. 

**Using Pro or Con SPOs and Paragraphs as Stepping Stones**

Before asking your students to undertake an entire argumentative essay—which would raise two points of view and present evidence for and evaluate each—first give them ample practice planning a single paragraph that summarizes the arguments for a position on one side, backed by evidence. 

Next, they can practice planning another single paragraph that summarizes the opposing view—again, backed by evidence. These activities will prepare them to write a pro/con essay that neutrally presents two points of view. The activities will also equip students for the more challenging task of deciding which position is stronger and why, which they'll confront when they write argumentative essays. 

It's important to include language like “some argue,” and “others say” in a pro/con essay. If the second half of the sentence just says, “it led him to take actions that caused a great deal of suffering,” the author is making an argument rather than neutrally summarizing claims on both sides—and that kind of writing belongs in an argumentative essay, not a pro/con one. 

**Matching Opposing Topic Sentences with Details**

A great way to introduce the skill of constructing arguments on two sides is to provide two SPOs, one pro and one con, that have only the topic sentences filled in. At the top, provide a list of details, in note form, and ask students to match each detail to the appropriate topic sentence. As always, when first introducing students to this activity, model it by guiding the whole class through it orally. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole gave her class the following activity on zoos. One topic sentence took a pro-zoo position and the other an anti-zoo one. Students had to look at the list of details provided and copy them onto the appropriate dotted lines. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

provide food + water + shelter

captivity → animals distressed

care for injured + abandoned animals

educate visitors/conservation

small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)

no socializing w/ others → bored

protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct

visitors tease animals

T.S. Zoos are harmful to animals and should be abolished. 

1. ***small exhibits/little room to roam (e.g., elephants)***

2. ***captivity → animals distressed***

3. ***no socializing w/ others → bored***

4. ***visitors tease animals***

T.S. Zoos provide benefits to both animals and people. 

1. ***provide food + water + shelter***

2. ***care for injured + abandoned animals***

3. ***protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct***

4. ***educate visitors/conservation***

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo gave his history class the following activity about the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. 

**DIRECTIONS:** Write each detail under the appropriate topic sentence. 

conservation

not enough progress/civil rts

over-regulated business

treatment of Nat. Amer. 

PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression

constructed Panama Canal

supported workers

consumer rts. 



T.S. Theodore Roosevelt's presidency was flawed. 

1. ***PR + Philippines → expansion + aggression***

2. ***not enough progress/civil rts*****. **

3. ***over-regulated business***

4. ***treatment of Nat. Amer*****. **



T.S. Theodore Roosevelt left a great legacy. 

1. ***conservation***

2. ***supported workers***

3. ***constructed Panama***** Canal**

4. ***consumer rts***

By providing details, you're essentially doing the research for your students so they can focus on deciding which evidence supports which claim. 

When embedded in the content of the curriculum, this activity will also encourage your students to engage in close reading of texts. They'll need to think carefully to decide which details from the text go with which topic sentence. 

Tell your students they should list the strongest reason or evidence last, where it will have the most impact on the reader. That means they'll need to decide which detail provides the strongest argument in support of each claim. This practice evaluating the strength of claims will also prepare students for deciding which position they want to take when it's time to write argumentative essays. 

**Creating Pro/Con SPOs from Scratch**

Once students have become familiar with matching details to the appropriate topic sentence and evaluating their strength, they can start creating their own SPOs. Tell them to write a topic sentence and a concluding sentence for each paragraph—pro and con—and write supporting details in note form on the dotted lines of each outline. 

**Level 1 Example**

Ms. Cole decided her class was now ready to build on their previous activities by creating their own SPOs on the subject of zoos—one summarizing the pro arguments and the other summarizing the opposing view. To do this, they would need to create topic and concluding sentences. 

Since her students were second graders, they hadn't yet been introduced to all three strategies for creating effective topic and concluding sentences—

using one of the sentence types, using an appositive, and using a subordinating conjunction. Ms. Cole had taught them only the first strategy, using one of the four sentence types: a command, a question, an exclamation, or a statement. She reminded them of each type before they began filling out their SPOs. 

The following are examples of the SPOs students produced:

T.S. ***Zoos benefit animals in many ways*****. **





1. ***provide food + water + shelter***

2. ***care for injured + abandoned animals***

3. ***protect endangered species → ↓ animals extinct***

4. ***educate visitors/conservation***



C.S. ***Zoos keep animals safe and help them survive*****. **



T.S. ***It is cruel to keep animals in zoos*****. **





1. ***small exhibits/little place to roam (e.g., elephants)***

2. ***captivity → animals distressed***

3. ***could never survive in the wild***

4. ***visitors tease animals***



C.S. ***Boycott zoos! ***



**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo also had his history students plan their own pro/con SPOs on Theodore Roosevelt. He required his students to come up with different topic sentences than the ones he had supplied for the matching activity, and he reminded them of the three strategies to create one. 

Similarly, he required students to come up with some different details than the ones he had provided. He reminded them to include the sources for the details in note form so that they would be able to provide citations or incorporate quotations from the text if and when they turned their SPOs into paragraphs. 

T.S. ***Theodore Roosevelt's presidency had shortcomings*****. **





1. ***used force to achieve foreign policy***

2. ***over-regulated business***

3. ***not enough progress/civil rts***

4. ***treatment of Nat. Americans***



C.S. ***Although Theodore Roosevelt accomplished a great deal, his presidency was flawed*****. **

T.S. ***Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, had a positive impact on the United States*****. **



1. ***nat'l parks + exp. forests***

2. ***labor unions***

3. ***constructed Panama Canal***

4. ***consumer rts/Food and Drug Administration***



C.S. ***In conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt left an impressive record of accomplishments*****. **

**TOs and MPOs for Pro/Con Compositions**

The next phase in developing the skills necessary for the argumentative essay is to have students create a TO or MPO that considers both sides but doesn't take a position. To do that, they can build on their existing pro and con SPOs or use a new topic. 

As we discussed in Chapter 9, the first steps in creating TOs and MPOs are for you to select a topic and lead the students in developing a thesis

statement. If students are choosing a new topic at this point, make sure that it's both debatable and manageable—neither too broad nor too narrow. 

Ask yourself if students will be able to handle the amount of evidence or research required. 

A TO or MPO for a pro/con essay might look something like the ones in Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2:

**Transition Outline (TO)**

**Exhibit 10.2**

As always, the TO and the MPO will differ in what they require of students. In a pro/con TO, students will write thesis and concluding statements that consist of one sentence acknowledging that there are arguments on both sides. A thesis statement might be:

***There are arguments for and against increasing the minimum wage*****. **

Alternatively, students can construct a thesis or concluding statement for a pro/con essay that makes use of a subordinating conjunction:

***Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on many small businesses, others***

***claim that an increased wage would be beneficial to many households*****. **

Remember that if students leave out a phrase like “others claim that,” they're constructing a thesis statement for an *argumentative* essay, not a pro/con essay. A thesis statement for an argumentative essay would read like this:

***Although some argue that increasing the minimum wage would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, an increased***

***wage would be beneficial to many households*****. **

This thesis statement signals that the author has considered the evidence on both sides, has come to a conclusion about which side makes more sense, and is prepared to defend that conclusion with evidence. You can introduce your students to the distinction between pro/con and argumentative thesis statements at this point, but if they haven't had sufficient practice with pro/con essays, they may not be ready to move on to argumentative writing. 

If students are developing an MPO rather than a TO, they'll need to construct a thesis statement but not a concluding statement. When they write their draft, they'll create general and specific statements for their introductory and concluding paragraphs, along with a reworded thesis statement to use in the latter. 

**The Argumentative Essay**

An argumentative essay has to be both persuasive and fair. Students will need to convince the reader that their own position is the stronger one but, at the same time, present the opposing point of view accurately. Their experience writing neutral pro/con essays will help them with the latter task. 

Composing argumentative essays will enhance skills that your students will generally find useful in later life, in the workplace, and personally. 

**Of all the writing genres, argumentative writing will be the most effective at sharpening students' analytical faculties. Learning** **to construct and defend an argument will enable them to think logically and critically. **

**Using an MPO to Plan an Argumentative Essay**

Before your students can start creating an MPO for an argumentative essay, they have to decide which position they're taking. To do that, they'll need to understand the facts and evidence on both sides. Be sure that the class has spent ample time studying and discussing the topic first. 

Students need to know that when creating a thesis statement for an argumentative essay, they should put the argument they're making last. For example, if a student wants to argue that the Industrial Revolution was essentially a positive development, they would *not* write: Although the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, its drawbacks cannot be ignored. 

Instead, they would end the sentence with the point that the Industrial Revolution brought benefits, as in this sentence: Although the Industrial Revolution had its drawbacks, the many benefits it brought cannot be ignored. 

In addition to the introductory and concluding paragraphs—which will use the GST and TSG structures—the essay will have three or more body paragraphs (see Exhibit 10.3). 

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction GST

**2nd paragraph. ** Lays out the background of the issue accurately, but presents evidence in a way that tends to support the author's position. 

**3rd paragraph. ** Presents the counterclaim and the evidence to support it. 

**4th paragraph. ** Provides the strongest evidence for the author's point of view. 

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion TSG

**Exhibit 10.3**

The standard argumentative essay often consists of five or more paragraphs, although this is not always a requirement. However, when your students begin to write these essays, you may decide to limit them to four paragraphs. They will omit the paragraph right after the introduction that lays out the problem and introduces their own argument. Instead they'll have only two body paragraphs: the first presenting the counterclaim and evidence and the second presenting their own claim and evidence. 

**Students should not attempt to raise a claim and rebut it in the same paragraph. ** In our experience, that approach often leads to a fragmented and confusing presentation of the information. 

**Incorporating Evidence and Quotations**

Since students are unlikely to be experts in the topics they're writing about, they'll need to introduce citations, paraphrases, and quotations. Although they should cite authorities supporting both sides, they'll need to show why those who support their own side are more convincing. 

At the MPO stage, your students won't actually be incorporating complete citations and quotations, but they will be making notations on their outlines referring to them. Later, they'll integrate that evidence as footnotes and references when they convert their MPOs into drafts and final copies. To prepare your students for that task, have them practice introducing quotations and other evidence in a way that supports a claim (see

Chapter 9). 

Certain words are particularly well suited to framing quotations or paraphrases in argumentative writing. When introducing a quotation or summary that supports their claim, students should characterize the source in a way that indicates its authority and uses stronger verbs than *says* or even *believes* to introduce the statement. More powerful verbs include *endorses*, *asserts*, *emphasizes*, *reminds us*, and *affirms*. 

For example, a student seeking authority in arguing against harsh forms of juvenile justice could simply write the following: Professor Clarke said, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

Think how much more mileage the student could get out of that quotation by framing it with an appositive that indicates the speaker's authority and using a verb that links the speaker's ideas to the student's own point of views, such as:

Professor Clarke, a nationally recognized expert on juvenile justice reform, endorses this view when she writes, “Programs like boot camps have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

Illustration transitions are also effective ways to introduce textual evidence and quotations, as shown here:

Experts in the field of juvenile justice reform agree that harsh measures don't work. **For example, ** Professor Clarke has written that boot camps

“have been shown to be ineffective in preventing juvenile delinquency.” 

**Level 2 Example**

Mr. Hidalgo felt that his students were now ready not only to summarize the arguments on both sides of the debate, but also to take a position and evaluate claims on the other side. He asked his students to think carefully about the arguments on each side and then choose the position they

personally felt was stronger. Their next task was to craft a thesis statement that stated their position and acknowledged a counterclaim. 

He also wanted his students to start citing sources for their evidence and quotations, so he told them to be sure to note them on the details lines of

their MPOs. Exhibit 10.4 shows the MPO that one of his students produced.

**Differentiating Argumentative Assignments**

Level 1 students are not yet experienced enough to plan and write argumentative essays. Therefore, they should keep practicing opinion and pro/con pieces until they've developed the skills necessary for tasks like writing general, specific, and thesis statements; engaging in research; and distinguishing between stronger and weaker arguments. 

However, you may be teaching a class where some Level 2 students are ready to plan argumentative essays using the MPO and others should instead use the TO. Those using the TO will not need to create general and specific statements, and they may not dive as deeply into the evidence, but they will be acquiring skills that will enable them to write more fully fleshed-out argumentative essays in the future. 

**Argumentative Terms**

As students move to more sophisticated expository and argumentative writing, consider giving them lists of words that are geared to those types of writing. For

example, topic sentences using words such as *although* or *while* work particularly well for both pro/con and argumentative writing. 

This would be a good point to introduce your students to words that will come in handy in presenting arguments that are made by others. For example, they can describe those on one side as *proponents* and those on the other as *naysayers*. Instead of simply using the verb *said*, they can use verbs such as *argue* and *maintain*. 

**EXAMPLES:**

Defenders of Theodore Roosevelt argue…. 

Critics of Theodore Roosevelt assert…. 

Exhibit 10.5 provides a list of terms to help students craft their pro/con and argumentative TO and MPO thesis statements.

**Review: Argumentative Writing Activities**

If you're a middle or high school teacher, the following scaffolds will help you guide your students through the activities that lead to the crafting of an argumentative essay. These activities will enable students to organize their material more effectively, think more analytically, and write more coherently as they prepare to tackle argumentative assignments. 

If you're an elementary teacher, your students are probably not yet ready to create argumentative essays. However, if you use the activities leading up to pro/con essays, you'll be laying the foundation for their ability to write argumentative essays at higher grade levels. 

**SENTENCE‐LEVEL STRATEGIES**

Use *because-but-so* activities to present students with a sentence stem that takes a position and have them: Connect a claim to evidence ( *because*), introduce a counterclaim ( *but*), and describe cause/effect relationships ( *so*). 

Use subordinating conjunctions ( *while*, *although*, and *even though*) to write sentences that acknowledge a counterclaim and state a claim. 

Use sentence-expansion activities to present students with a kernel sentence that takes a position. 

Use transition activities to present and evaluate reasons, evidence, and claims. 

**SINGLE‐PARAGRAPH OUTLINE**

Practice writing topic sentences for paragraphs that summarize a position on one side of an issue, using the three strategies for creating them: Sentence type (a statement expressing the position of advocates)

Subordinating conjunction

Appositive

Match topic sentences taking opposing positions with appropriate details. 

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes a position, backed by evidence. 

Use an SPO to plan a paragraph that summarizes an opposing view, also backed by evidence. 

**TO AND MPO: PRO/CON**

Practice writing a pro/con thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument without taking a position for a TO (e.g., “Although there are many who argue that an extended school year will benefit students, opponents believe that additional time will not produce meaningful results”). 

Write a complete pro/con TO or MPO that presents the evidence for two sides of an argument without taking a position. 

**MPO: ARGUMENT (FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL 2 STUDENTS)**

*Some students in a class might be ready for the argumentative essay but not yet ready for the MPO, in which case they should use the TO*. 

Practice writing an argumentative thesis statement that presents two sides of an argument and takes a position, placing the author's position at the end of the thesis statement (e.g., “Although extending the school year has many drawbacks, its benefits outweigh them”). 

Develop a four- or five-paragraph MPO that lays out two sides of an argument and takes a position. 

**1st paragraph. ** Introduction: Write only “GST” in the Details box. The thesis statement should be written as a complete sentence on the solid line above the outline. 

**2nd paragraph. ** Lay out the background of the issue accurately, but in a way that tends to support the author's position. (When students are first being introduced to the argumentative MPO, they may omit this paragraph.)

**3rd paragraph. ** Present the counterclaim and the evidence to support it. 

**4th paragraph. ** Provide the strongest evidence for the author's point of view. 

**5th paragraph. ** Conclusion: Write only “TSG.” 

**DRAFTING AND REVISING**

Generate general and specific statements. 

Practice using transition words and phrases to present and evaluate reasons and claims:

Time and sequence: List reasons and claims on each side. 

Illustration: Provide examples of a general claim or introduce evidence. 

Emphasis: Highlight important claims or underscore an argument. 

Change of direction: Introduce or acknowledge opposing claims. 

Conclusion: Signal wrapping up an argument. 

Practice activities that introduce and explain a quotation in a way that supports a claim. 

**To Sum Up**

To be able to plan and write an effective argumentative essay, your students will need to be able to do the following: Understand the difference between fact and opinion. 

Use nouns and verbs that are well suited to argumentative writing (see Exhibit 10.5). 

Integrate quotations with appropriate introductions and explanations. 

Use the SPO to plan two separate paragraphs presenting opposing points of view and evidence to support them. 

Use the TO to plan pro/con essays that present two points of view and supporting evidence in a neutral manner. 

Use the MPO (or TO) to plan four- or five-paragraph argumentative essays that take a position backed by evidence. 

Determine which piece(s) of evidence is (are) the strongest and therefore should be mentioned last.
