## Reading Passage: The Library on the Lake

**Paragraph 1**  
For years, the lakeside warehouse sat empty. Its windows were boarded, and its dock was quiet. The wooden beams inside gathered dust, and gulls perched on the roof. After months of planning, the city turned the old building into something new — a public library. The renovation kept the timber beams and tall windows. Now, they surrounded shelves of books, small reading corners, and wide tables for study.

**Paragraph 2**  
Visitors came by foot, bicycle, and even kayak. They tied their boats to the dock before coming inside. On quiet mornings, students worked in bright rooms with views of the water and the hills beyond. In the afternoons, families explored the children's wing or joined storytelling sessions. Local artists hung colorful paintings along the walls. Musicians sometimes played in the open atrium, and their music floated across the lake like a soft breeze.

**Paragraph 3**  
At first, some residents were unsure about the location. They worried about parking and the cost of caring for a building by the water. Those worries faded when cafés and small shops opened nearby. Weekend markets began on the dock, selling fresh bread, fruit, and handmade crafts. A water taxi linked the library to neighborhoods across the lake, making visits easy and enjoyable.

**Paragraph 4**  
The library soon became more than a place for books. Monthly talks drew people from all over the city. Workshops, hands-on courses led by local experts, taught skills from boatbuilding to computer design. On summer evenings, the deck outside showed films under the stars. What was once a forgotten warehouse became a busy place for learning, art, and community life. It proved that a good idea and careful planning can change the story of a place.
