## Reading Passage: A Day in the Life Aboard the International Space Station

**Paragraph 1**  
Life on the International Space Station (ISS) follows a routine that keeps astronauts healthy and organized. Even though the station circles Earth every ninety minutes, the crew uses Coordinated Universal Time so everyone stays on the same schedule.

**Paragraph 2**  
Astronauts begin their morning with basic hygiene. Simple tasks like washing and brushing teeth are more difficult in microgravity. Water floats in small drops, so astronauts squeeze it from pouches and wipe themselves clean with no-rinse soap. Toothpaste can be swallowed or spat into a cloth. Clothing also behaves differently. Loose items drift away, so astronauts secure shirts and shorts in storage racks and often wear each set for several days.

**Paragraph 3**  
Breakfast is quick because the workday is busy. Most foods are dehydrated or heat-stabilized, and astronauts add hot water to rehydrate certain items. Crumbs can float into equipment, so the crew chooses foods that stay together. Utensils and meal pouches attach to trays with Velcro.

**Paragraph 4**  
A large part of each day is spent on scientific research. The ISS offers a microgravity environment that lets scientists study how plants grow, how fluids move, and how new tools work. Every experiment must be set up carefully. Wires, tubes, and instruments are secured so they do not drift around the cabin.

**Paragraph 5**  
Exercise is also essential. Without gravity, muscles and bones weaken quickly. Astronauts work out for about two hours a day using a treadmill with a harness, a stationary bicycle, and a resistance device. These activities help the crew stay strong and prepare for their return to Earth.

**Paragraph 6**  
Evenings are calmer. Astronauts complete small tasks, talk with mission control, and eat dinner together. Before bed, each person gets into a sleeping bag fastened to a wall or inside a small compartment so they do not float around while sleeping.

**Paragraph 7**  
Although life on the ISS is very different from life on Earth, astronauts rely on routines to stay safe and focused. Careful planning and teamwork make it possible for the crew to live and work while orbiting far above the planet.
