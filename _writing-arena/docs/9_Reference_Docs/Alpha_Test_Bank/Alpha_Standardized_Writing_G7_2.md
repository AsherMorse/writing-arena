## Reading Passage: Safe Streets, Stronger Town

**Paragraph 1**  
A small town decided to add bike lanes to its main roads. For years, the streets were busy, and many people felt unsafe walking or riding. When the new lanes opened, things began to change. The lanes, a bright green path along the road, guided riders and reminded drivers to slow down.

**Paragraph 2**  
Students could bike to school without hugging the curb. Shops stayed open a little later, and more customers stopped by on their way home. The local market saw new faces each weekend. Parents said the streets felt calmer in the evening, and children could play outside for a little longer before dinner.

**Paragraph 3**  
Not everyone agreed at first. Some residents worried that the lanes would remove parking spots. Delivery drivers said turning would be harder on narrow blocks. To solve these problems, the town held open meetings. Workers added loading zones near the corners, and volunteers put up clear signs about the rules for bikes and cars.

**Paragraph 4**  
After a few months, the number of minor crashes went down. More families chose to ride together on sunny days. Shop owners noticed that people stayed longer and talked with neighbors outside. Today, the bike lanes are part of daily life, reminding everyone that small changes can lead to safer travel, stronger business, and friendlier streets.
