## Reading Passage: The Bridge

**Paragraph 1**  
For decades, the old steel bridge stood quietly over the river. Its paint had faded, and weeds grew between the wooden planks of the walkway. Many people in the city avoided it, choosing faster roads instead. That changed when the city decided to restore the bridge, turning it into a space for walkers, cyclists, and community events.

**Paragraph 2**  
The work kept the bridge's tall white towers and graceful steel arches but replaced the worn planks with smooth paths for bikes and strollers. Lantern-style lights lined the walkway, and benches offered views of the river. Planters filled with bright flowers added color in every season.

**Paragraph 3**  
When the bridge reopened, people came in large numbers. Families strolled across to watch boats pass underneath. Cyclists used it for their daily rides, and tourists stopped to take photographs. Seasonal events now drew visitors from across the region.

**Paragraph 4**  
Businesses near the bridge noticed more customers. Cafés filled with walkers and cyclists stopping for coffee. Souvenir stands, small wooden booths selling postcards and sketches of the towers, popped up along the waterfront. Street musicians played for passing crowds. Parks at both ends of the bridge were redesigned, adding playgrounds and picnic areas.

**Paragraph 5**  
The bridge became more than a way to cross the river. It was a gathering place, an outdoor stage, and a link between neighborhoods. It showed how a single project could connect people, support local businesses, and bring new life to an overlooked part of the city.
