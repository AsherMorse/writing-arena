## Reading Passage: from Surprise Kick

*Cody and his best friend Mud are devoted fans of the video game Soccer Slam. But when they try real soccer for the first time, Cody ends up on the Red Team, while Mud plays for the Blue Team.*

**Paragraph 1**  
At the kickoff, Cody positions himself near Mud, assuming his friend won't be involved much. Cody also figures he can step in to help if the other team swarms Mud.

**Paragraph 2**  
Ryan passed the ball sharply across the field to Amanda. Cody had always been curious why Amanda chose to play on the boys' team. He didn't have to wonder for long. She sidestepped one defender with impressive control. Then she planted her feet and used her body to shield the ball from another opponent, refusing to back down.

**Paragraph 3**  
But before long, Amanda found herself surrounded. With no clear path forward, she made a quick decision and passed the ball—directly to Mud.

**Paragraph 4**  
Cody tensed, bracing for a mistake. He assumed Mud would lose control immediately. The Red defenders charged at him, confident they could take the ball. But to Cody's astonishment, Mud darted between Mitch and Hans, skillfully weaving down the field.

**Paragraph 5**  
Cody blinked, stunned. Since when was Mud this fast? Mahender lunged to intercept, but Mud twisted past him. Mitch reached in to steal, but Mud adjusted smoothly and unleashed a powerful kick.

**Paragraph 6**  
The ball soared past the goalie and slammed into the net—Blue Team scored the first goal!

**Paragraph 7**  
Mud's teammates raced toward him, cheering wildly and showering him with high-fives. Cody, still trying to process what he had seen, spent the rest of the game chasing the ball but never managed to catch up.
