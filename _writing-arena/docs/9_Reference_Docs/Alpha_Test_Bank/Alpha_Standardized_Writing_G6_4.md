## Reading Passage: The Age of Language

**Paragraph 1**  
In a busy neighborhood café, people speak many different languages. A family at one table talks in Spanish. At the counter, a worker sings along to a French song on the radio. Scenes like this happen across the United States, a country shaped by immigrants. Even though English is the most common school language, many Americans grow up using two languages at home and in their communities.

**Paragraph 2**  
Learning a second language helps people in many ways. Studies show it can strengthen memory and improve problem-solving skills. Scientists also say young children learn new sounds easily because their brains are still developing. This means starting early can give kids a strong head start when learning another language.

**Paragraph 3**  
One way children learn is through immersion. In an immersion class, the teacher uses the new language all day. Students hear it during lessons, group work, and even simple requests, like asking to use the bathroom. Because they must use the language often, students pick up new words quickly. They also learn grammar by listening to how the language sounds in real life.

**Paragraph 4**  
Another helpful method uses real communication. Some classrooms connect students with pen pals in other countries. Children write letters or emails and share stories about their daily lives. These friendships motivate students to practice more and help them understand different cultures. Real communication shows that language learning has a purpose.

**Paragraph 5**  
Experts still study how age affects language learning. Some believe older students learn better in structured lessons. Others think younger children learn naturally because they copy sounds and accents more easily. No matter the method, language learning can open doors. It helps kids connect with others and explore the world with confidence.
