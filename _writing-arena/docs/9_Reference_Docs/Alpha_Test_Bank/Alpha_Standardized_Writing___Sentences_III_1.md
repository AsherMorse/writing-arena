## Reading Passage: Owning Up

Crista wrote this paper about a mistake she made. Read Crista's paper and look for revisions she needs to make. Then answer the questions that follow.

### Owning Up

**1** Each morning, I drop my backpack in the classroom and head to breakfast. **2** Today, Ms. Kessler wasn't at her desk. **3** I had always been curious about what she does at her desk in the mornings. **4** I wandered over to take a peek.

**5** I leaned over her desk and saw some papers, her coffee, and a tiny bag of candy. **6** I hoped the candy was for a science experiment or a math assignment! **7** I stood up straight. **8** My backpack knocked Ms. Kessler's coffee mug onto the floor. **9** Her coffee spilled, and the handle cracked off the mug. **10** My stomach sank — Ms Kessler would be disappointed.

**11** I considered cleaning it up but panicked and ran to the cafeteria. **12** My friends were chatting, but I couldn't stop thinking about the mess. **13** When I returned, Ms. Kessler was already cleaning. **14** Guilt weighed on me. **15** Finally, while the rest of the class filed in. **16** Voice shaking, I admitted what I had done.

**17** She listened and then a hug for me. **18** She said, "Everyone makes mistakes, but the important thing is to be honest about them. **19** And it always feels better to do it right away!"

**20** She was right. **21** Next time, I'd own up right away.
