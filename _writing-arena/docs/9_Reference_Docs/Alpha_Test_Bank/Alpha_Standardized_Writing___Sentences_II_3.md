## Reading Passage: The Big Change

**1** Noah peered into the cloudy water swirling in the jar, where he had placed three tadpoles from the creek. **2** They swished their tiny tails as if waving hello. **3** He placed them in a small fish tank in his backyard, filled with creek water to help them feel at home.

**4** Noah's new little pets seemed to be on this first day mostly eyes and tails. **5** Their big heads bobbled as they swam.

**6** The next morning, Noah woke up early to feed the tadpoles. **7** He asked his mom for some lettuce. **8** She looked confused—he never ate vegetables! **9** He quickly explained it was for the tadpoles. **10** He had read that they liked lettuce along with tiny bugs in the water.

**11** Over the next few days, the tadpoles chased each other like little fish. **12** After a week or two, Noah noticed each one had grown a pair of tiny legs just in front of their tails. **13** Slowly, their heads started to look more like frogs, and bulges on their sides became arms. **14** Noah added stones. **15** They could climb on the stones when they were ready. **16** As their legs grew, their tails shrank.

**17** One morning, three small frogs sat on a rock. **18** Noah returned them to the creek where he found them. **19** Nearby, a caterpillar. **20** Maybe it was time to make a new friend.
