## Reading Passage: The Power of Animated Movies for Children

**Paragraph 1**  
Animated movies are fun and colorful. Many children love watching them. But these movies do more than just entertain. They can also teach important lessons about life, feelings, and how to treat others.

**Paragraph 2**  
In many animated movies, characters face big problems. Sometimes they lose something they love or make a mistake. They often have to find the courage to fix things or try again. When children see this, they learn that it's okay to make mistakes and that trying again is part of growing.

**Paragraph 3**  
Animated movies also show how to be kind and honest. For example, a story might show a character helping a friend or telling the truth even when it's hard. These moments can help children understand right and wrong.

**Paragraph 4**  
These films often include teamwork and friendship. Characters learn to listen, forgive, and work together. This helps young viewers understand how to solve problems with others.

**Paragraph 5**  
Another good thing is that many animated movies show different people, places, and ideas. This helps children learn about the world. They can become more open to new thoughts and more caring about others who are different from them.

**Paragraph 6**  
While movies can't replace real-life lessons from parents and teachers, they can still help. Watching stories about bravery, kindness, and hope can make children think about how they act in their own lives.
