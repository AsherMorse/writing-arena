Let's use the conjunctions "because", "but", and "so" to expand sentences.

In this example, we are given the sentence "Water is good for us."

{{example_question}}

We can rewrite this sentence as:

{{example_solution}}

> "Water is good for us because it keeps our bodies cool."

Note, when expanding the sentence using a 'so' conjunction, this activity wants you to expand the sentence by adding details that are a consequence of the original sentence.

For example:

{{so_example_question}}

> "I miss you."

An incorrect expansion for this activity would be:

{{so_example_incorrect_answer}}

> "I miss you so much."

because it doesn't explain the consequence of "I miss you."

A correct sentence for this activity could be:

{{so_example_correct_answer}}

> "I miss you, so I wrote you a letter."
