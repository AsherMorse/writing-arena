In this exercise you will identify two parts:

- The topic sentence - similar to previous exercises, the topic sentence is usually the first sentence of a paragraph that introduces the main idea or topic that will be written about.
- The least relevant sentence - there will be one sentence which will not fit the main topic being discussed by the topic sentence. It will be unrelated or possibly related but not very relevant.

{{ example }}

> The water makes puddles on the ground.
> It's easy to slip on ice.
> Sunny days are great for playing outside.
> The ice melts on sunny days.

You select the topic sentence by selecting "Topic", and the irrelevant sentence by selecting "Irrelevant".

In the example, the topic sentence is "The ice melts on sunny days". It introduces the idea of ice melting. The irrelevant sentence is "Sunny days are great for playing outside" because it does not have anything to do with ice melting into water.
