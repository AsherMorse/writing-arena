## What is a Topic Sentence?

A topic sentence introduces the **main idea** of a paragraph. It tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Topic sentences are usually (but not always) found at the beginning of a paragraph.

## How to Identify a Topic Sentence:

1. It introduces the **main subject** or idea of the paragraph
2. It is more **general** than the other sentences
3. The other sentences in the paragraph **support** or **expand** on this main idea
4. It does not usually contain specific details or examples

In this exercise, you will identify the topic sentence in a paragraph. You will see several sentences that form a paragraph, but they may be in a different order. Your job is to select the sentence that best introduces the main idea.

{{ sample }}

In the example above, the topic sentence is "**Science is my favorite subject in school because it helps me understand the world around me.**" This sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph - that science is the favorite subject and why. The other sentences provide specific details and examples that support this main idea:

- The sentence about plant growth experiments is a **specific example** of a science activity
- The sentence about using microscopes is another **specific detail** that supports why science is interesting

Remember, the topic sentence introduces the main idea, while the supporting sentences provide details and examples.
