In this example sentence, "Although" is the subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause. 

- The **main clause** is "we still decided to go for a walk," which expresses the main idea or action of the sentence. 

- The **dependent clause** "it was raining" provides additional information or sets a condition that affects the main clause.
