In this exercise you will practice writing Single Paragraph Outlines based on a specific topic.

A Single Paragraph Outline is a plan that helps you write a paragraph. It includes the following parts:

1. **Topic Sentence**: This is the first sentence of the paragraph that introduces the main idea or point.
2. **Supporting Details**: These are a few sentences or short notes that add more detail or further explain the topic.
3. **Concluding Sentence**: The last sentence that wraps up the paragraph. It summarizes the idea or gives a final thought about the topic.

Here is an example topic and Single Paragraph Outline:

When these parts are put together, they create a complete paragraph:

"Dogs are wonderful pets. They are loyal and provide constant companionship. Additionally, dogs can be trained to perform tasks or tricks, making them both fun and helpful. Owning a dog can bring joy and friendship into a home."
