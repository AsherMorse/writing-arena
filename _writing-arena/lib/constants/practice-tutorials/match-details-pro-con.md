# Matching Details with Pro/Con Topic Sentences

> In this activity, you'll practice identifying whether details support a "pro" (in favor) or "con" (against) position on a topic.

## How It Works

{{ pro_con_example }}

> You'll see a topic at the top with some background information, followed by two different viewpoints: a "pro" statement that supports the topic and a "con" statement that argues against it.

> Below these, you'll find several details that need to be sorted. Each detail supports either the pro viewpoint or the con viewpoint.

## Your Task

> Your job is to read each detail carefully and decide whether it supports the pro statement or the con statement.

> Drag each detail to the correct category box:
> - If a detail supports the pro statement, drag it to the PRO box.
> - If a detail supports the con statement, drag it to the CON box.

## Tips for Success

1. **Read carefully:** Make sure you understand both the pro and con statements before sorting details.

2. **Look for clues:** Pay attention to language that suggests support (like "benefit," "advantage," "helps") or opposition (like "problem," "disadvantage," "limits").

3. **Think about connections:** Ask yourself, "Does this detail provide evidence for the pro statement or the con statement?"

4. **Be thorough:** Sort all details before submitting your answer.

> For example, with the topic "School Uniforms":
> - A detail like "reduces clothing costs for families" supports the pro statement about uniforms having benefits.
> - A detail like "limits personal expression" supports the con statement about uniforms having disadvantages.
