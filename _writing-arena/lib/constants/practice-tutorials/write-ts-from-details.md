# Writing Topic Sentences from Details

## What is a Topic Sentence?

A **topic sentence** is the sentence that states the main idea of a paragraph. It tells the reader what the paragraph is about and guides the supporting details that follow.

## Your Task

In this activity, you'll be given a set of details about a specific subject. Your job is to:

1. Carefully read the details provided
2. Identify the main idea that connects all the details
3. Write a clear, concise topic sentence that captures this main idea

## Example

**Details:**
- Founded in 1776
- 50 states
- Washington D.C. is the capital
- Has three branches of government

**Example Topic Sentence:**
"The United States is a democratic country with a rich history and unique governmental structure."

## Tips for Success

- Make sure your topic sentence is a complete sentence
- Include the main subject that the details are about
- Be specific enough to preview what the paragraph is about
- Be broad enough to encompass all the details
- Use clear, concise language

Remember, the best topic sentences clearly communicate the main idea without including too many specific details.
