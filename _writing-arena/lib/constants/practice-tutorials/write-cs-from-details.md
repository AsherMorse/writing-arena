# Writing Concluding Sentences from Details

## What is a Concluding Sentence?

A **concluding sentence** is the final sentence of a paragraph that wraps up the main ideas and provides a sense of closure. It reminds the reader of the paragraph's purpose and leaves them with a final thought.

## Your Task

In this activity, you'll be given:
1. A topic sentence (the first sentence that states the main idea)
2. Supporting details that develop the main idea
3. Optional context about the topic

Your job is to write a concluding sentence that effectively wraps up the paragraph by:
1. Restating the main idea in different words
2. Summarizing the key points
3. Providing a sense of closure

## Example

**Topic Sentence:** "The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth."

**Supporting Details:**
- Home to over 1,500 species of fish
- Contains 400 types of coral
- Stretches for over 2,300 kilometers
- Visible from space

**Example Concluding Sentence:**
"With its vast size and incredible variety of marine life, the Great Barrier Reef truly stands as a natural wonder that deserves protection."

## Tips for Success

- Don't simply repeat the topic sentence word for word
- Avoid introducing new ideas not mentioned in the paragraph
- Use signal words like "therefore," "in conclusion," or "clearly" to indicate you're concluding
- Keep it concise and focused on the main idea
- Consider the tone of the paragraph (informative, persuasive, etc.) and match it

Remember, the concluding sentence should give the reader a sense that the paragraph is complete.
