The word choice is precise and appropriate ('excellent,' 'loyal companions'). To reach a 5, the sentence could incorporate more sophisticated vocabulary or an additional sentence type like an appositive to add more depth."

          "feedback": "The detail sentences strongly support the topic sentence with three well-developed points: unconditional love, physical activity benefits, and mental health support. The paragraph demonstrates varied sentence structures including compound sentences and complex sentences with subordinating conjunctions ('since'). Transitions are used effectively throughout ('First,' 'Additionally,' 'Furthermore'). Word choice is sophisticated ('unconditional love,' 'greet their owners with excitement,' 'experience lower stress levels'). The details are logically ordered and fully developed with specific examples."

          "feedback": "The concluding sentence 'In conclusion, the loyalty, activity benefits, and emotional support that dogs provide make them the ideal pet for families' effectively summarizes the main points using a transition ('In conclusion'). It restates the key ideas without simply repeating the topic sentence. The word choice is precise ('ideal pet'). To achieve a 5, consider using an additional sentence type such as a subordinating conjunction or appositive to add sophistication."
