# WritingArena: Daily Core Flow

## Home Screen

Student sees 3 options:

| Option | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Daily Challenge** | Today's ranked writing battle (1 attempt/day) |
| **Practice** | Unlimited writing on topics they like, at their level |
| **Hole-Fill** | Targeted lessons to fix skill gaps *(recommended if gaps detected)* |

**Note**: Hole-fill is highlighted/recommended when AI has detected gaps from previous sessions. Gaps are prioritized by: (1) severity first (urgent low scores), (2) foundational skills second (sentence → paragraph → essay).
