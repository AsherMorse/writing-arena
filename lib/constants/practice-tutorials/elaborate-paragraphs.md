In this exercise, you will practice revising and elaborating on a paragraph. We start with a bare-bones paragraph consisting of short, simple sentences. Using the skills you've learned so far, your job is to expand and enrich the sentences, combining them into a flowing paragraph. Some ideas on what to revise could include:

- Using an appositive in the topic sentence
- Expanding the topic sentence with details about When or Where
- Combining two sentences into one
- Answering why something happened
- Giving examples
- etc

For example, the following is a very simplified paragraph:

{{ simple }}

> I have a pet dog. His name is Buddy. Buddy has brown fur. He likes to run. He barks loud. I love playing with Buddy.

But it could be revised into this:

{{ revised }}

> My pet dog Buddy is fluffy with shiny brown fur that feels soft when I pet him. He runs really fast in the park, his ears flopping in the wind. Sometimes, when he barks, it's so loud that it surprises me! Playing fetch with Buddy is my favorite thing to do after school because it makes us both super happy.

If you need help, the Ideas section has suggestions you can use for revision.
