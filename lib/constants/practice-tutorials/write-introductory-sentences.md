In this activity, you will write **additional specific statements** that connect your general statement (G) to your thesis statement (T). These extra specific statements (often called S2, S3, etc.) build on your initial specific statement (S1) to narrow down the topic further and provide more context, detail, or examples.

A good additional specific statement goes beyond merely repeating your first specific statement—it offers new angles, new details, or transitional elements that help the reader see how your introduction moves logically from a broad opening to your central argument.

Below are examples showing how these additional statements might work. Notice how they add more context or detail while keeping the discussion focused on the path from G to T.

## Example: Social Media's Impact

**General (G):**  
"The rapid evolution of digital technology has fundamentally transformed how humans communicate and interact with each other."

**Specific (S1):**  
"Teenagers today spend an unprecedented amount of time on social media platforms, often several hours per day scrolling through carefully curated content."

**Additional Specific (S2):**  
"Moreover, these platforms often incorporate targeted advertisements and influencer endorsements, creating a culture of constant comparison and consumerism."

**Thesis (T):**  
"While social media offers valuable opportunities for connection and self-expression, its emphasis on comparison and validation creates dangerous psychological pressures for adolescents."

**Why it works:**

- The first specific statement (S1) introduces the idea of teens using social media excessively.
- The additional specific statement (S2) deepens the focus by pointing out the influence of advertising and influencers, which ties directly into the thesis on comparison and psychological pressure.
- Together, S1 and S2 create a clear path from the broad idea of digital transformation (G) to the central argument about social media's psychological effects on adolescents (T).

## What Makes a Good Additional Specific Statement?

1. **Uses Concrete Details**  
   Add fresh examples or observations that build upon the initial specific statement without simply restating it.

2. **Stays Focused**  
   Connect clearly to both your first specific statement (S1) and your thesis, ensuring each new detail supports your main argument.

3. **Provides Context**  
   Offer insights or background that help readers see why these details matter in relation to both your general statement and thesis.

4. **Uses Clear Language**  
   Avoid vague phrases. Be direct and precise to keep your bridge strong and easily understandable.

5. **Bridges Ideas**  
   Show readers how the discussion progresses naturally from the broader topic (G) to your argument (T), ensuring that each statement transitions smoothly to the next.

Remember:  
Your additional specific statements (S2, S3, etc.) should reinforce the flow between your general opening (G) and your thesis (T). Think of each new specific statement as another stepping stone that brings your reader closer to understanding your argument in a detailed, compelling way.
