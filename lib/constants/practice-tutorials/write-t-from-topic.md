## What is a Thesis Statement?

> A thesis statement is a single sentence that summarizes the main point of your essay and presents your position on a topic. It serves as a roadmap for your paper, telling the reader exactly what to expect.

## Tips for Writing a Strong Thesis Statement

> Here are some helpful tips for writing an effective thesis statement:

1. **Be specific:** Avoid vague or general statements.
   > For example, instead of saying "Social media is bad for teenagers," try "The constant pressure to maintain a perfect online image on social media platforms contributes to rising anxiety levels among teenagers."

2. **Take a position:** Your thesis should state your perspective on the topic.
   > Instead of saying "There are both pros and cons to social media use," try "The benefits of social media for teenagers, such as community building and creative expression, are undermined by its negative effects on mental health."

3. **Make it debatable:** Your thesis should be something someone could reasonably disagree with.
   > Saying "Teenagers use social media frequently" is just a fact. A better thesis would be "Schools should implement social media literacy programs to help teenagers navigate online spaces more healthily."

4. **Be concise:** A thesis statement should be one sentence that clearly expresses your main idea.

5. **Use your own words:** Your thesis statement should be original - don't copy directly from the background information or examples.

> Remember, your thesis statement is the foundation of your entire essay, so take time to craft one that is clear, specific, and debatable.
