In this activity, you will write a specific statement that connects a general statement to a thesis statement.

A good specific statement serves as a bridge between the broad opening (general statement) and your main argument (thesis statement). It helps narrow down the topic and provides concrete details that support your thesis.

Here are some examples of how specific statements work in introductions:

## Example 1: Social Media's Impact

**General:** "The rapid evolution of digital technology has fundamentally transformed how humans communicate and interact with each other."

**Specific:** "Teenagers today spend an unprecedented amount of time on social media platforms, often several hours per day scrolling through carefully curated content."

**Thesis:** "While social media offers valuable opportunities for connection and self-expression, its emphasis on comparison and validation creates dangerous psychological pressures for adolescents."

## Example 2: Shakespeare's Use of the Supernatural

**General:** "Throughout literary history, authors have used supernatural elements to explore human nature and morality."

**Specific:** "In Shakespeare's tragic play Macbeth, witches, ghosts, and prophecies appear at crucial moments, driving characters to make fateful decisions."

**Thesis:** "While these supernatural elements create an atmosphere of mystery and fate, they ultimately function as external manifestations of Macbeth's internal moral decay and ambition."

## What Makes a Good Specific Statement?

1. **Uses Concrete Details**: Include specific facts, examples, or observations
2. **Stays Focused**: Directly relates to both the general statement and thesis
3. **Provides Context**: Helps readers understand the connection between the broad topic and your argument
4. **Uses Clear Language**: Avoids vague statements and uses precise terms
5. **Bridges Ideas**: Creates a logical flow from general to thesis

Remember: Your specific statement should help readers understand how you got from your broad opening to your main argument.
