In this activity, you need to label each sentence in this introduction with its type.

These sentences make up an introduction designed to answer the prompt that is provided.

An introduction is typically composed of at least three sentences. These sentences are defined as general, specific, and a thesis statement.

The general statement is a broad, clear, and engaging sentence that is relevant to the prompt and to the topic that you will write about.

The specific statement is more specific than the general statement. It's connected to the general statement and helps transition to the thesis statement. There can be one, two, or even three specific statements in an introduction.

The thesis statement is the most important sentence and is almost always the final sentence of the introduction. The Thesis reflects the essay's main idea or position, and should typically include a plan of development or an outline of the main points that the essay will cover. 

Here's a few simple examples of labeling a few sentences:


## Example 1:

**General:** "Some books, despite being written decades ago, remain timely."

**Specific:** "The Great Gatsby still captivates readers with its wealth-driven moral decay."

**Thesis:** "Although published in 1925, its characters, setting, and conflicts resonate with modern audiences."


## Example 2:

**General:** "Many Olympians have made a significant impact on their sport"

**Specific:** "In 1936, an athlete impressed spectators at the Berlin Olympics with his skill and talent"

**Thesis:** "Jesse Owens, a formidable Black track and field star, is remembered for shattering world records"


## Example 3 with 2 specific sentences:

**General:** "As the United States grew in industrial and economic power, two controversial figures emerged."

**Specific:** "By the end of the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie controlled almost the entire steel industry and John Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company controlled 90% of the refining business."

**Specific:** "Both men made tremendous philanthropic contributions that made them heroic in the views of many."

**Thesis:** "However, there have been debates about whether these early builders of big business in America should be considered 'robber barons' or 'captains of industry'"
