In this activity, you need to decide which of these sentences are fragments, and which are complete sentences.

Once you find the fragments, you'll make a new, complete sentence using the fragment.

Let's look at the example below, which has two sentences: "the cat sleeps" and "in the morning".

{{example_question}}

"The cat sleeps" has a subject and a verb, so it's a complete sentence. "In the morning" is a fragment, because it doesn't have a subject or verb. We don't know what happened in the morning, or who did it.

Now that we've found the fragment, let's get creative and come up with a new, complete sentence using it.

All of these sentences are correct:

{{example_solution}}

> "I saw my teacher in the morning."

> "Will you be there in the morning?"

> "In the morning, I will attend practice."

Don't forget:

- A complete sentence has both a subject and a verb, and it expresses a complete thought. It makes sense all by itself.

- A fragment, on the other hand, is missing something important. It might have a subject or a verb, but not both, and it doesn't give you a clear, full idea.

- You need to capitalize your sentences and include punctuation for your answer to be correct.
