# Pre-Transition Outline

## What is a Pre-Transition Outline?

Think of a **pre-transition outline** as a blueprint for your essay. It's a plan you make *before* you start writing full paragraphs. This plan helps you organize your ideas and makes sure everything connects smoothly.

## Your Task

In this activity, you'll be given a topic. Your job is to create an outline with these parts:

1.  **Thesis Statement:** The main point or argument of your whole essay.
2.  **Topic Sentences:** The main idea for each body paragraph.
3.  **Supporting Details:** Notes or short phrases that give evidence for each topic sentence.
4.  **Concluding Statement:** A sentence that wraps everything up.

Here's what the form looks like:

Let's break down each part.

### 1. Topic (Given)

> The topic is the subject your essay will be about. We'll give you this part!
{{ Topic }}

### 2. Thesis Statement

> Your thesis statement is the most important sentence! It tells the reader your main argument.
> A good thesis statement:
> - Makes a clear claim about the topic.
> - Isn't just a fact, but something you can argue or explain.
> - Hints at the main points your body paragraphs will cover.
> - Is a complete sentence.
>
> Type your thesis statement here:
{{ Thesis Statement }}

**Tip:** Make sure your thesis clearly states your position on the topic! A vague thesis like "Exercise is important" isn't as strong as "Regular exercise improves physical and mental health by reducing stress and strengthening the body."

### 3. Paragraph Outlines

> Each body paragraph needs a plan.
>
> **Topic Sentence (T.S.):**
> This sentence starts the paragraph and introduces its main idea.
> - It must connect back to your thesis statement.
> - It tells the reader what *this specific paragraph* will be about.
>
> Type your topic sentences here:
{{ Topic Sentence 1 }}
{{ Topic Sentence 2 }}

> **Supporting Details (S.D.):**
> These are notes, facts, or examples that prove your topic sentence. You don't need full sentences here, just clear ideas. Aim for 2-3 details per paragraph.
> - Each detail must directly support the topic sentence of *that paragraph*.
>
> Add your supporting details:
{{ Supporting Details 1 }}
{{ Supporting Details 2 }}

**Tip:** Make sure your topic sentences clearly support different parts of your thesis. Avoid repeating the same idea in different paragraphs. Also, check that your supporting details *really* back up the topic sentence they are under.

### 4. Concluding Statement

> This is the final sentence of your outline. It should:
> - Briefly restate your thesis in a new way.
> - Summarize the main points from your topic sentences.
> - Give the reader a final thought.
>
> Write your concluding statement here:
{{ Concluding Statement }}

**Tip:** Your conclusion should tie everything together smoothly. Don't introduce new ideas here!

## Why This Matters

Making an outline *before* writing helps you:
- Put your ideas in a logical order.
- Make sure every part connects to your main argument (thesis).
- Catch any weak spots or missing information early.
- Write your essay faster because you have a clear plan!
