### What are Transition Words?

Transition words are special words we use in writing to link one idea to another. They're like signposts that guide the reader from one point to the next, making our writing clear and easy to follow. Let's look at the types you might encounter.

### Time-and-Sequence Transitions

- These words help us tell a story in order, from start to finish.

- Example words and usage:

{{ timeExample }}

> After. In addition. Then. Also.
> "I went to school. **After** that, I came home."

### Illustration Transitions

- These words help us wrap up our thoughts or explain why something happened.

- Example words and usage:

{{ illustrationExample }}

> For example. Like. Including. Specifically.
> "There are many ways to stay healthy. **For example**, you can exercise regularly."

### Emphasis Transitions

- These words help us highlight important parts, or prove a point.

- Example words and usage:

{{ emphasisExample }}

> Obviously. Certainly. Especially. Notably.
> "I love all fruits. **Especially,** I love apples."

### Conclusion Transitions

- These words help us wrap up our thoughts or explain why something happened.

- Example words and usage:

{{ conclusionExample }}

> So. Therefore. Finally. As a result.
> "I didn't study for the test. **So,** I didn't do well on it."

### Change of Direction Transitions

- These words help us show opposite thoughts, or another side of a story.

- Example words and usage:

{{ directionExample }}

> But. However. Although. Yet.
> "It was raining outside. **But** we still went to the park."
