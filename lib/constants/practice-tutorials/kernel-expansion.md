In this exercise, you are going to expand a kernel sentence (which looks like a short statement) into a longer sentence with more details. 

You'll need to get creative to answer a few of the **six basic questions**:

- **Who** is involved?
- **What** happened?
- **When** did it take place?
- **Where** did it take place?
- **Why** did it happen?
- **How** did it happen?

---

Let's take a look at an example.

{{ question }}
> The kernel sentence is: "Pyramids were built."

This is a complete sentence, but we can get creative and give it some more detail. Let's brainstorm by asking ourselves a few basic questions:

- **When** were the pyramids built?
- **Where** were the pyramids built?
- **Why** were the pyramids built?

Let's brainstorm some answers to these questions:

{{ expansion }} 
> When: Ancient times
> Where: Egypt
> Why: To protect the body of the pharaoh

Now that we have some ideas, we can rewrite the kernel sentence into the following sentence:

{{ answer }}

> In ancient times in Egypt, pyramids were built to protect the body of the pharaoh.

Don't forget:

- You need to capitalize your sentences and include proper punctuation for your answer to be correct.
- Sentences must follow the rules of grammar and make sense.
- Your answers to the six basic questions — "who", "what", "when", "where", "why", and "how" — must be related to the kernel you were given.
