In this activity, you will write both a general statement and a specific statement that lead to a thesis statement.

A good introduction paragraph typically moves from broad to specific, ending with your main argument (thesis). The general statement introduces the broad topic, while the specific statement provides concrete details that bridge to your thesis.

Here are some examples of how these statements work together in introductions:

## Example 1: Social Media's Impact

**General:** "The rapid evolution of digital technology has fundamentally transformed how humans communicate and interact with each other."

**Specific:** "Teenagers today spend an unprecedented amount of time on social media platforms, often several hours per day scrolling through carefully curated content."

**Thesis:** "While social media offers valuable opportunities for connection and self-expression, its emphasis on comparison and validation creates dangerous psychological pressures for adolescents."

## Example 2: Shakespeare's Use of the Supernatural

**General:** "Throughout literary history, authors have used supernatural elements to explore human nature and morality."

**Specific:** "In Shakespeare's tragic play Macbeth, witches, ghosts, and prophecies appear at crucial moments, driving characters to make fateful decisions."

**Thesis:** "While these supernatural elements create an atmosphere of mystery and fate, they ultimately function as external manifestations of Macbeth's internal moral decay and ambition."

## What Makes Good Introduction Statements?

1. **General Statement Should:**
   - Introduce the broad topic
   - Be universally true or widely accepted
   - Avoid specific details
   - Set the context for your argument

2. **Specific Statement Should:**
   - Provide concrete details or examples
   - Narrow down the topic
   - Connect directly to your thesis
   - Use clear, precise language

Remember: Your statements should create a logical flow from broad topic to specific argument, helping readers understand how you arrived at your thesis.
