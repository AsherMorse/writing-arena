# AI-Powered Competitive Writing Platform

## Project Overview

This platform transforms writing instruction through extrinsic motivation and competitive gameplay. Students participate in Counterstrike-style writing matches, earning points, ranks, and achievements while developing mastery across five writing traits.

## Key Features

- **Writer Character System**: Growing avatar that evolves through 6 mastery levels (Seedling → Legendary Redwood)
- **Learning Science-Aligned Design**: Cognitive Load Theory, retrieval practice, metacognitive instruction
- **Competitive Matchmaking**: Counterstrike-style party formation with AI players
- **Balanced Motivation System**: Intrinsic motivation support with strategic extrinsic rewards
- **Capstone Project**: Op-ed writing reviewed by editors and published in local newspapers
- **Formative Assessment**: AI-driven learning guidance and mastery tracking

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React/Next.js with real-time WebSocket connections
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for assessment, feedback, and AI player generation
- **Matchmaking Engine**: Skill-based party formation with automated AI player inclusion
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with session recordings and portfolio storage

## Design Philosophy

The platform integrates Learning Science principles with balanced motivation approaches. Cognitive Load Theory guides scaffolding, retrieval practice ensures retention, metacognitive instruction develops self-regulation, and formative assessment drives learning. The writer character/avatar system provides visual growth representation, embodying growth mindset through tangible character evolution from seedling to legendary writer.

## Learning Science Foundation

- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Adaptive scaffolding manages working memory constraints
- **Retrieval Practice & Spacing**: Distributed learning builds durable knowledge
- **Metacognitive Development**: Self-regulation strategies for planning, monitoring, evaluation
- **Formative Assessment**: Diagnostic feedback guides learning trajectories
- **Growth Mindset**: Character progression embodies skill development through effort
- **Automaticity Building**: Fluency development frees cognitive resources
- **Balanced Motivation**: Intrinsic support with strategic extrinsic incentives

## Project Structure

- `DESIGN_SCHEMA.md`: Unique design philosophy and visual concepts
- `PRD_Overview.md`: Executive summary and platform architecture
- `PRD_Matchmaking.md`: Counterstrike-style party formation system
- `PRD_Motivation.md`: Extrinsic reward and ranking system
- `PRD_Capstone.md`: Op-ed writing and publication process

## Getting Started

1. Review the design schema for visual and conceptual foundation
2. Read PRD_Overview.md for high-level platform understanding
3. Dive into specific components based on development focus
4. Use extrinsic motivation principles throughout implementation

This platform creates a self-sustaining competitive writing environment that motivates through external rewards while delivering genuine skill development.
