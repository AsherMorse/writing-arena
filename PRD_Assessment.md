## Mastery Classification System

### Five Core Writing Attributes
1. **Content (CON):** Addressing questions with unity, relevance, appropriate examples
2. **Organization (ORG):** Development and structural coherence within and between paragraphs
3. **Grammar (GRM):** Syntactic complexity and variety used accurately
4. **Vocabulary (VOC):** Range and appropriateness of lexical items
5. **Mechanics (MCH):** Conventions including punctuation, spelling, capitalization
